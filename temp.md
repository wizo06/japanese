### Adding more wagons to the train

We learned at the beginning that the **core** of every Japanese sentence is only composed of two parts: the main wagon "A"" and the engine "B".

main wagon "A" + が | engine "B"
:---: | :---:
- | -

Let's try adding a **non-core** wagon to our hypothetical train: the 「を」 wagon. This 「を」 wagon contains one noun, which is bundled with the 「を」 particle. We will have a more in-depth look at particles in a later section. Let's look at an example sentence:

Note: 「私」（わたし）means "I"  
「ケーキ」means "cake"  
「食べる」means "eat"

**「私がケーキを食べる」**

main wagon "A" + が | を wagon | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---:
私が | ケーキを | 食べる

This means "I eat cake". The core of the sentence is "I eat" ("A" wagon + engine "B"). The 「を」 wagon is just telling us more about the engine, i.e. *what I eat*. Now, the interesting thing is that we may often see this being said like this:

**「ケーキを食べる」**

main wagon "A" + が | を wagon | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---:
Ø が | ケーキを | 食べる

As we learned in a previous section, this is another case of the invisible "A" wagon. We can't have have a sentence without the "A" wagon. We can't have an action being done without a doer. We can't eat something without an eater. If we say 「ケーキを食べる」, what we're really saying is 「Øがケーキを食べる」. The default value for Ø in the invisible wagon is "I". But, if we're talking about "someone else" at that time, then the context changes and Ø might mean that "someone else". 

**The key takeaway point in this section is that non-core wagons simply add more details *about* the core elements. These details can be things like describing the *where* I ate the cake, *with whom* I ate the cake, etc. However, the core will always be the main wagon "A" and the engine "B".**

**How do native speakers use the copula 「だ」?**  
In casual, everyday conversation, you will most likely hear native speakers say "A is B" *without* saying the copula 「だ」. For example, a dialogue between two friends can look like:

Note: 「元気」 means "in good health"

Person A: 元気？  
Person B: うん、元気。

*Nautral Englsh*  
Person A: Are you OK? / Are you fine? / How are you doing? / How are you?  
Person B: Yeah, I'm OK. / Yeah, I'm fine. 

To fit this dialogue into our train analogy, it will look like this:

**Person A**

main wagon "A" + が | engine "B" + ? 
:---: | :---:
Ø が | 元気?

**Person B**

A simple "yes" | main wagon "A" + が | engine "B" + だ
:---: | :---: | :---:
うん、 | Ø が | 元気

Notice the "zero pronoun" (Ø) in both lines. We will see what's going on there in a later section called "Invisible "A" wagon in sentences".

In person A's line, when *asking* a question, you can't use the copula. Remember that the copula *defines*/*states*/*declares* that "A is B". If you're asking a question, that means you *don't know* if "A is B". Therefore, you ommit the copula and simply say "B?" when you want to ask a question. We will learn more about how to ask questions in a later section.

The important point I want to bring up right now is person B's line. Person B said "Yes, I **am** OK" 「うん、元気。」 in Japanese without actually saying the copula 「だ」. This is very common in casual conversations, but that does not mean that the copula is not necessary to make a complete "A is B" sentence.

Just like in any other language, casual, everyday conversations don't always follow grammar rules perfectly. However,

1. knowing the rules and the correct way of saying things, and 
2. knowing how native speakers break those rules 

are essential to 

1. understanding what you're listening and/or reading (input), and
2. speaking and/or writing naturally -sounding like a native speaker- (output).

**So when do native speakers actually say 「だ」?**  
Well, the main difference is that a *declarative* statement -such as explicitly saying 「だ」 in an "A is B" sentence- makes the sentence sound more emphatic and forceful in order to make it more... well *declarative*. Therefore, it is more common to hear men use 「だ」 at the end of sentences. Dropping the 「だ」 at the end of sentences makes it sound more "soft" and therefore it is more common to hear women dropping the 「だ」.

**Let me re-emphasize that this is in the context of *casual, everyday conversation*. A *complete and proper sentence* still requires the copula 「だ」in an "A is B" sentence.**

**How do native speakers use 「は」?**  
It is very common for native speakers to drop almost all the words in a sentence or question, to keep it as short as possible. The unspoken part of the sentence is expected to be inferred by the listener based on context.

For example, a person might ask a roommate in English:

**"What should we eat for dinner?"**

But for a Japanese speaker, they can ask the same question by saying:

Note: 「夕飯」 means "dinner"

- **「夕飯は？」**

The literal translation is *"As for dinner?"*. Of course, the actual complete sentence (though not said out loud) can be something like:

- **「夕飯は何にする？」**

Which can be roughly translated as *"As for dinner, what should we eat?"*.

Let's look at another dialogue:  

Note: 「今夜」（こんや）means "tonight"  
「空いてる」（あいてる）means "free" (as in "available" or "have time")  
「残念」（ざんねん）means "unfortunate"  
「俺」means "I" (masculine tone)

*Suppose that two friends want to go try out a new restaurant that just opened up*  
**アリス：「私は今夜空いてるよ。ボブさんは？」**  
**ボブ：「残念。俺は今夜忙しいんだ」**

*Literal translation (not quite literal, but I tried my best)*  
**Alice: As for me, (I) am free tonight. As for Bob?**  
**Bob: Unfortunate. As for me, (I) am busy tonight.**

*Natural English*  
**Alice: I am free tonight. What about you?**  
**Bob: That's unfortunate. I'm busy tonight.**

Notice how Alice says 「ボブさんは？」 which literally means *"As for Bob?"*. When Alice first started her sentence, she said 「私は。。。」 which means *"As for me..."*. This means that the current topic is "Alice". By using the 「は」 particle again when she asked 「ボブさんは？」, she has now changed the topic. Changing the topic in this paritcular way in this particular context implies *"What about you (Bob)?"*.

The complete question would be 「ボブさんは今夜空いてる？」 which means *"As for Bob, are (you) free tonight?"*. You can see that even in English, asking "What about you?" was enough to convey the meaning of the whole question without actually saying it out loud.

Let's look at another dialogue as example:

Note: 「明日」（あした）means "tomorrow"

**アリス：リエさんは明日？**  
**ボブ：ううん、明日じゃない。**

*Literal translation*  
**Alice: As for Rie, tomorrow?**  
**Bob: No, not tomorrow.**

Since we don't have enough context, we don't have enough information to make sense of this conversation. Given a context, as long as the sentence has something to do with "Rie" and "tomorrow", it can mean anything. For instance, they could be talking about when Rie is taking an exam.

Let's look at another example:

Note: 「試験」（しけん）means "exam"

**アリス： 今⽇は試験だ。**  
**ボブ： ジョンは？**  
**アリス： ジョンは明⽇。**

*Literal translation*  
**Alice: In relation to today, (it) is exam.**  
**Bob: As for John?**  
**Alice: As for John, (it is) tomorrow.**

*Natural English*  
**Alice: Today is the exam.**  
**Bob: What about John?**  
**Alice: John will take it tomorrow.**

This example shows how generic the topic of a sentence can be. A topic can be referring to any action or object from anywhere even including other sentences. For example, in the last sentence 「ジョンは明⽇」, even though the sentence is about when the exam is for John, the word "exam" doesn't appear anywhere in the sentence!

Let's look at another example:

**ボブ： アリスは学⽣？**  
**アリス： うん、学⽣。**

*Literal translation*  
**Bob: As for Alice, are (you) a student?**  
**Alice: Yes, (I) am a student.**

*Natural English*  
**Bob: Are you a student?**  
**Alice: Yeas, I am.**

Here, Bob is marking "Alice" as the topic when he asked 「アリスは学⽣？」. Notice that once the topic is established, Alice does not have to repeat the topic to answer the question about herself. We know that the zero pronoun is "Alice" based on context. The full sentence from Alice is 「うん、私はØが学生だ。」. 

The 「は」 particle has other properties and nuances, but we will look at them in a later section when we compare 「は」 with 「が」.

## Complete and proper sentence

Japanese grammar allows the omission of the subject (main wagon "A"), and it also allows the omission of the topic (we will learn more about "topic" in a later section). Therefore, a complete and proper sentence in Japanese can simply be:

Engine "B" |
:---: |
- |

*(As we learned in the previous section, it is important to remember that the main wagon "A" is still there. It's just invisible. )*

Because Japanese grammar allows such omissions, this means that, if we want to say a sentence in a "neutral" way, we can simply say:

- Engine "B"

But if we choose to make emphasis on the topic, or the main wagon "A", or both, then we can say it in these ways:

- Topic + Engine "B"
- Main wagon "A" + Engine "B"
- Topic + Main wagon "A" + Engine "B"

The nuance between them will become clearer as we learn more about particles, and as we get more input (immersion).
