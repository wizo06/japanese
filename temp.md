### Adding more wagons to the train

We learned at the beginning that the **core** of every Japanese sentence is only composed of two parts: the main wagon "A"" and the engine "B".

main wagon "A" + が | engine "B"
:---: | :---:
- | -

Let's try adding a **non-core** wagon to our hypothetical train: the 「を」 wagon. This 「を」 wagon contains one noun, which is bundled with the 「を」 particle. We will have a more in-depth look at particles in a later section. Let's look at an example sentence:

Note: 「私」（わたし）means "I"  
「ケーキ」means "cake"  
「食べる」means "eat"

**「私がケーキを食べる」**

main wagon "A" + が | を wagon | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---:
私が | ケーキを | 食べる

This means "I eat cake". The core of the sentence is "I eat" ("A" wagon + engine "B"). The 「を」 wagon is just telling us more about the engine, i.e. *what I eat*. Now, the interesting thing is that we may often see this being said like this:

**「ケーキを食べる」**

main wagon "A" + が | を wagon | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---:
Ø が | ケーキを | 食べる

As we learned in a previous section, this is another case of the invisible "A" wagon. We can't have have a sentence without the "A" wagon. We can't have an action being done without a doer. We can't eat something without an eater. If we say 「ケーキを食べる」, what we're really saying is 「Øがケーキを食べる」. The default value for Ø in the invisible wagon is "I". But, if we're talking about "someone else" at that time, then the context changes and Ø might mean that "someone else". 

**The key takeaway point in this section is that non-core wagons simply add more details *about* the core elements. These details can be things like describing the *where* I ate the cake, *with whom* I ate the cake, etc. However, the core will always be the main wagon "A" and the engine "B".**

**How do native speakers use the copula 「だ」?**  
In casual, everyday conversation, you will most likely hear native speakers say "A is B" *without* saying the copula 「だ」. For example, a dialogue between two friends can look like:

Note: 「元気」 means "in good health"

Person A: 元気？  
Person B: うん、元気。

*Nautral Englsh*  
Person A: Are you OK? / Are you fine? / How are you doing? / How are you?  
Person B: Yeah, I'm OK. / Yeah, I'm fine. 

To fit this dialogue into our train analogy, it will look like this:

**Person A**

main wagon "A" + が | engine "B" + ? 
:---: | :---:
Ø が | 元気?

**Person B**

A simple "yes" | main wagon "A" + が | engine "B" + だ
:---: | :---: | :---:
うん、 | Ø が | 元気

Notice the "zero pronoun" (Ø) in both lines. We will see what's going on there in a later section called "Invisible "A" wagon in sentences".

In person A's line, when *asking* a question, you can't use the copula. Remember that the copula *defines*/*states*/*declares* that "A is B". If you're asking a question, that means you *don't know* if "A is B". Therefore, you ommit the copula and simply say "B?" when you want to ask a question. We will learn more about how to ask questions in a later section.

The important point I want to bring up right now is person B's line. Person B said "Yes, I **am** OK" 「うん、元気。」 in Japanese without actually saying the copula 「だ」. This is very common in casual conversations, but that does not mean that the copula is not necessary to make a complete "A is B" sentence.

Just like in any other language, casual, everyday conversations don't always follow grammar rules perfectly. However,

1. knowing the rules and the correct way of saying things, and 
2. knowing how native speakers break those rules 

are essential to 

1. understanding what you're listening and/or reading (input), and
2. speaking and/or writing naturally -sounding like a native speaker- (output).

**So when do native speakers actually say 「だ」?**  
Well, the main difference is that a *declarative* statement -such as explicitly saying 「だ」 in an "A is B" sentence- makes the sentence sound more emphatic and forceful in order to make it more... well *declarative*. Therefore, it is more common to hear men use 「だ」 at the end of sentences. Dropping the 「だ」 at the end of sentences makes it sound more "soft" and therefore it is more common to hear women dropping the 「だ」.

**Let me re-emphasize that this is in the context of *casual, everyday conversation*. A *complete and proper sentence* still requires the copula 「だ」in an "A is B" sentence.**
