???+ tip "How do native speakers actually use だ-engine?"

    Colloquially, you will most likely hear native speakers have a **dialogue/conversation** without ending their sentences with 「だ」. For example, a dialogue between two close friends can look like:

    Note: 「元気」 means "in good health"

    Person A: 元気？  
    Person B: うん、元気。

    *Nautral Englsh*  
    Person A: Are you OK? / Are you fine? / How are you doing? / How are you?  
    Person B: Yeah, I'm OK. / Yeah, I'm fine. 

    To fit this dialogue into our train analogy, it will look like this:

    **Person A**

    Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---:
    Ø が | 元気?

    **Person B**

    A simple "yes" | Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    うん、 | Ø が | 元気

    The point I want to make here is that *person B* said "Yes, I **am** OK" 「うん、元気。」 in Japanese without actually saying the "**am**" part (without actually saying the copula 「だ」). This is very common in casual **dialogues/conversations**. In fact, it's so common to the point where if you end your sentences in 「だ」 in casual **dialogues/conversations**, you might sound like an anime character (specifically shounen anime).

    Here are two lines from an anime character:

    - 俺はガキではないの ==だ==。
    - 俺の店 ==だ==。

    If this was a real life conversation, it would probably be like this instead:

    - 俺はガキじゃない ==よ== / 俺はガキじゃないん ==だよ==
    - 俺の店 / 俺の店 ==だよ==

    Let's look at another example. This time we will look at a real life conversation between two guys from a reality TV show called "Terrace House":

    - いつ行くの？
    - 俺ね、来週かな。
    - 俺、３日だよ。
    - だよね、早いよね。
    - 俺のほうが早いよ。

    As you can see, they don't end their sentences with 「だ」. This can be rephrased to sound more like anime characters:

    - いつ行くの{++だ++}？
    - 俺は来週{++だ++}。
    - 俺は３日{++だ++}。
    - そうか、貴様、早いの{++だ++}な。
    - 俺のほうが早い{++ぜ++}。

    Hopefully, you can see that it sounds very anime-ish.

    **So when do native speakers say 「だ」?**  
    Like we saw earlier, it's not that they don't say 「だ」, it's just that they dont end their sentences in 「だ」 in a casual **dialogue/conversation**. In a casual conversation, it is a lot more natural to end your sentences with 「よ」、「ね」、「な」、「よね」、「かな」、etc. These are called "sentence ending particles", and we will learn about them in a later section. Regardless of which engine the sentence is using, native speakers like to end it with a "sentence ending particles" during **dialogues/conversations**. And if the sentence happens to be using a だ-engine, then it will be 「だ」＋「。。。」, such as 「だよ」、「だね」、「だよね」、etc. It is also very common for women to omit 「だ」 even if the sentence is using the だ-engine. Example:

    - ヤキモチ妬き ==だよね==　←　Neutral
    - ヤキモチ妬き ==よね==　←　Feminine

    **However**, there are times when native speakers do end their sentences in 「だ」. This typically only occur when it's **NOT** a dialogue/conversation. There are many reasons, and one of them is to make the sentence sound more emphatic. For example, if a guy is confessing his love to a girl, he might shout:

    - 好きだ！

    Other reasons to end a sentence in 「だ」 are:

    - Emphatic self-expression (like the 「好きだ！」 we saw earlier)
    - Sounding the alarm
    - Invading personal space
    - Casual conversation (this is often accompained with sentence ending particles, like we discussed earlier)

    Explaining each reason is beyond the scope of this grammar guide. If you wish to read more about it, you can start [here](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/da-vs-desu-in-real-life/).

    Side note: this doesn't mean that learning Japanese from watching anime is a bad idea. In fact I strongly encourage it (assuming you like watching anime in the first place). To learn more about why I encourage this, watch [this video by Matt](https://youtu.be/V9ND6uw6-QA).


## Relative clauses

We learned how to modify/describe a noun by using the engine.

What is a *clause*? To put it in simple terms, a clause is basically a sentence that is inside another sentence. Let's recall our train analogy here.

Main wagon | Engine
:---: | :---:
A | B

In this analogy, there are 3 types of engines.

Engine name | Used for | Sentence type
:---: | :---: | :---:
う-engine | verb | A does B
だ-engine | noun | A is B
い-engine | adjective | A is B

Now, let's look at an example sentence.

- 美味しい。  
*Is delicious.*

Now let's say we want to describe a "cake" by saying "Delicious cake" (not to be confused with "cake is delicious"). We would say:

- 美味しいケーキ。  
*Delicious cake* (Lit: Cake that is delicious)

What if I want to say "cake that was bought at a bakery", we would say:

- パン屋さんで買ったケーキ。  
*Cake that was bought at a bakery*

In both sentences, 「美味しい」 and 「パン屋さんで買った」 are describing 「ケーキ」. And we can see that in Japanese, in both cases, that description is said *before* 「ケーキ」. However, in English the order of this "description" switches back and forth, depending on how long or complex the description is. In the first example, "*delicious*" was short and simple, so it is correct to say "*Delicious cake*". But in the second sentence, "*bought at a bakery*" is too long, and saying "*Bought at a bakery cake*" would be incorrect. We would have to say the description *after* "cake": "*Cake that was bought at a bakery*".

Let's look at another example where the "description" is long:

- 友達が先週本屋さんで買った本  
*Book that my friend bought at a book store last week*

The entire description is still said *before* 「本」 in Japanese. This is how Japanese works. Now let's go back to our question "*what is a clause?*" If we look at the "description" part, that sentence in itself is already a complete sentence.

main wagon "A" | に | で | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
友達が | 先週 | 本屋さんで | 買った

That entire sentence -or more precisely, *clause*- is describing the word that follows it: 「本」. So if we include the 「本」 into the train, it would look like this:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="4" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">Clause</th>
    <th rowspan="2" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">main wagon "A"</th>
    <th rowspan="2" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">main wagon "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">に</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">で</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">友達が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">先週</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">本屋さんで</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">買った</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">本</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">?</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Right now, the *clause* that describes 「本」 is a complete sentence in itself, but the entire sentence as a whole is not complete. Let's complete the sentence by adding the engine to it:

- 友達が先週本屋さんで買った本が面白い！  
*The book that my friend bought at a book store last week is interesting!*

Clause | main wagon "A" | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---:
友達が先週本屋さんで買った | 本が | 面白い！

or, it can also be visualized as such:

main wagon "A" | engine "B"
:---: | :---:
友達が先週本屋さんで買った本が | 面白い！

because in reality, the "clause" is just describing "A". The clause doesn't have a wagon of its own. Putting this train analogy aside, what's important is that this sentence is just an "A is B" sentence at the core, and we've simply added more details *about* "A". Let's highlight the "description" part, so we can more easily see that this sentence is really just "A is B" at its core.

- **友達が先週本屋さんで買った**本が面白い！  
*The book __that my friend bought at a book store last week__ is interesting!*

If we omit the description, the core of the sentence is really just "The book is interesting!" 「本が面白い！」.

This is the part where learning the 3 engines during the Sentence Structure section was crucial. Since we can describe any noun (in this case, a "book") by using a clause (which is a complete sentence on its own), then we can use any of the 3 engines to describe the noun.

Examples of **う-engines** clauses that describe a noun (I will highlight the clause in bold):

- **歩く**さくら  
*Sakura who walks*

- **友達が飲んだ**ジュース  
*Juice that friend drank*

- **走ってる**私  
*Me who is running* / *A running me*

- **休んでる**先生  
*Teacher who is taking a break* 

Let's look at examples of **い-engines** clauses that describe a noun:

- **美味しい**ケーキ  
*Delicious cake* / *Cake that is delicious*

- **美しい**姫  
*Beautiful princess* / *Princess that is beautiful*

- **赤い**ペン  
*Red pen* / *Pen that is red*

Let's look at examples of **だ-engines** clauses:

- ❌ 親切だ人

That is incorrect. The correct way of saying it is:

- ⭕ **親切な**人  
*Friendly people*

That's right. This is where the so called **"na-adjectives"** come from. The copula 「だ」 gets transformed into 「な」 when it is used to describe a word in this specific manner:

- 人は親切だ  
*People are friendly*

turns into:

- 親切な人  
*Friendly people* / *People that are friendly*

Now, the first sentence 「人は親切だ」 is a complete sentence. It is a sentence of type "A is B". But the second sentence is an incomplete sentence. It is merely saying "Friendly people".

Let's see some more examples of **だ-engines** clauses:

- **好きな**食べ物  
*Likeable food* / *Food that is liked*

- **有名な**人  
*Famous person* / *Person that is famous*

- **静かな**街  
*Quiet street* / *Street that is quiet*

- **便利な**場所  
*Convenient place* / *Place that is convenient*

- **上手な**学生  
*Skillful student* / *Proficient student* / *Student that is skillful*

- **必要な**書類  
*Necessary documents* / *Documents that are needed*

- **真面目な**後輩  
*Serious junior* / *Earnest junior* / *Junior who is serious*

### Word order

???+ warning

    **The order of the wagons doesn't really matter as long as the engine "B" is at the end. What matters is that the particles are attached to the correct word**. It is perfectly valid to say:

    - **「私がさくらにボールを投げる」**

    main wagon "A" + 「が」 | 「に」 wagon | 「を」 wagon | engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
    私が | さくらに | ボールを | 投げる

    and it means exactly the same thing as the previous sentence. **However if I changed the particles that the words are attached to, then the meaning of the sentence also changes**. For example:

    - **「私にボールをさくらが投げる」**

    「に」 wagon | 「を」 wagon | main wagon "A" + 「が」 | engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
    私に | ボールを | さくらが | 投げる

    This sentence means "Sakura throws the ball at me" or "Sakura throws the ball to me". If I say:

    - **「ボールが私にさくらを投げる」**

    main wagon "A" + 「が」 | 「に」 wagon | 「を」 wagon | engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
    ボールが | 私に | さくらを | 投げる

    This sentence means "The ball throws Sakura at me". 

In a previous section, when we learned about the particle 「は」, we aslo learned that:
> The order of the wagons doesn't really matter as long as the engine "B" is at the end. What matters is that the particles are attached to the correct word.

And this is mostly correct. I can say:

- 花を友達にあげる
- 友達に花をあげる

and they both mean exactly the same thing: "(I) give flowers to friend".

However, the order of the wagons doesn't matter **only if** the wagons stay inside their own clause. Let's look at the following example:

- 昨日泣いてた私が今日泣いている君を慰めている。  
*I, who was crying yesterday, is comforting you, who is crying today.*

In this sentence, we have two clauses that makes up the entire sentence.

Clause 1 | A | Clause 2 | を | B
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
昨日泣いてた | 私が | 今日泣いている | 君を | 慰めている。

Clause 1 is describing 「私」, clause 2 is describing 「君」.
