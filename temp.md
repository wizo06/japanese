### Adding more wagons to the train

We learned at the beginning that the **core** of every Japanese sentence is only composed of two parts: the main wagon "A"" and the engine "B".

main wagon "A" + が | engine "B"
:---: | :---:
- | -

Let's try adding a **non-core** wagon to our hypothetical train: the 「を」 wagon. This 「を」 wagon contains one noun, which is bundled with the 「を」 particle. We will have a more in-depth look at particles in a later section. Let's look at an example sentence:

Note: 「私」（わたし）means "I"  
「ケーキ」means "cake"  
「食べる」means "eat"

**「私がケーキを食べる」**

main wagon "A" + が | を wagon | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---:
私が | ケーキを | 食べる

This means "I eat cake". The core of the sentence is "I eat" ("A" wagon + engine "B"). The 「を」 wagon is just telling us more about the engine, i.e. *what I eat*. Now, the interesting thing is that we may often see this being said like this:

**「ケーキを食べる」**

main wagon "A" + が | を wagon | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---:
Ø が | ケーキを | 食べる

As we learned in a previous section, this is another case of the invisible "A" wagon. We can't have have a sentence without the "A" wagon. We can't have an action being done without a doer. We can't eat something without an eater. If we say 「ケーキを食べる」, what we're really saying is 「Øがケーキを食べる」. The default value for Ø in the invisible wagon is "I". But, if we're talking about "someone else" at that time, then the context changes and Ø might mean that "someone else". 

**The key takeaway point in this section is that non-core wagons simply add more details *about* the core elements. These details can be things like describing the *where* I ate the cake, *with whom* I ate the cake, etc. However, the core will always be the main wagon "A" and the engine "B".**

**How do native speakers use 「は」?**  
It is very common for native speakers to drop almost all the words in a sentence or question, to keep it as short as possible. The unspoken part of the sentence is expected to be inferred by the listener based on context.

For example, a person might ask a roommate in English:

**"What should we eat for dinner?"**

But for a Japanese speaker, they can ask the same question by saying:

Note: 「夕飯」 means "dinner"

- **「夕飯は？」**

The literal translation is *"As for dinner?"*. Of course, the actual complete sentence (though not said out loud) can be something like:

- **「夕飯は何にする？」**

Which can be roughly translated as *"As for dinner, what should we eat?"*.

Let's look at another dialogue:  

Note: 「今夜」（こんや）means "tonight"  
「空いてる」（あいてる）means "free" (as in "available" or "have time")  
「残念」（ざんねん）means "unfortunate"  
「俺」means "I" (masculine tone)

*Suppose that two friends want to go try out a new restaurant that just opened up*  
**アリス：「私は今夜空いてるよ。ボブさんは？」**  
**ボブ：「残念。俺は今夜忙しいんだ」**

*Literal translation (not quite literal, but I tried my best)*  
**Alice: As for me, (I) am free tonight. As for Bob?**  
**Bob: Unfortunate. As for me, (I) am busy tonight.**

*Natural English*  
**Alice: I am free tonight. What about you?**  
**Bob: That's unfortunate. I'm busy tonight.**

Notice how Alice says 「ボブさんは？」 which literally means *"As for Bob?"*. When Alice first started her sentence, she said 「私は。。。」 which means *"As for me..."*. This means that the current topic is "Alice". By using the 「は」 particle again when she asked 「ボブさんは？」, she has now changed the topic. Changing the topic in this paritcular way in this particular context implies *"What about you (Bob)?"*.

The complete question would be 「ボブさんは今夜空いてる？」 which means *"As for Bob, are (you) free tonight?"*. You can see that even in English, asking "What about you?" was enough to convey the meaning of the whole question without actually saying it out loud.

Let's look at another dialogue as example:

Note: 「明日」（あした）means "tomorrow"

**アリス：リエさんは明日？**  
**ボブ：ううん、明日じゃない。**

*Literal translation*  
**Alice: As for Rie, tomorrow?**  
**Bob: No, not tomorrow.**

Since we don't have enough context, we don't have enough information to make sense of this conversation. Given a context, as long as the sentence has something to do with "Rie" and "tomorrow", it can mean anything. For instance, they could be talking about when Rie is taking an exam.

Let's look at another example:

Note: 「試験」（しけん）means "exam"

**アリス： 今⽇は試験だ。**  
**ボブ： ジョンは？**  
**アリス： ジョンは明⽇。**

*Literal translation*  
**Alice: In relation to today, (it) is exam.**  
**Bob: As for John?**  
**Alice: As for John, (it is) tomorrow.**

*Natural English*  
**Alice: Today is the exam.**  
**Bob: What about John?**  
**Alice: John will take it tomorrow.**

This example shows how generic the topic of a sentence can be. A topic can be referring to any action or object from anywhere even including other sentences. For example, in the last sentence 「ジョンは明⽇」, even though the sentence is about when the exam is for John, the word "exam" doesn't appear anywhere in the sentence!

Let's look at another example:

**ボブ： アリスは学⽣？**  
**アリス： うん、学⽣。**

*Literal translation*  
**Bob: As for Alice, are (you) a student?**  
**Alice: Yes, (I) am a student.**

*Natural English*  
**Bob: Are you a student?**  
**Alice: Yeas, I am.**

Here, Bob is marking "Alice" as the topic when he asked 「アリスは学⽣？」. Notice that once the topic is established, Alice does not have to repeat the topic to answer the question about herself. We know that the zero pronoun is "Alice" based on context. The full sentence from Alice is 「うん、私はØが学生だ。」. 

The 「は」 particle has other properties and nuances, but we will look at them in a later section when we compare 「は」 with 「が」.

## Complete and proper sentence

Japanese grammar allows the omission of the subject (main wagon "A"), and it also allows the omission of the topic (we will learn more about "topic" in a later section). Therefore, a complete and proper sentence in Japanese can simply be:

Engine "B" |
:---: |
- |

*(As we learned in the previous section, it is important to remember that the main wagon "A" is still there. It's just invisible. )*

Because Japanese grammar allows such omissions, this means that, if we want to say a sentence in a "neutral" way, we can simply say:

- Engine "B"

But if we choose to make emphasis on the topic, or the main wagon "A", or both, then we can say it in these ways:

- Topic + Engine "B"
- Main wagon "A" + Engine "B"
- Topic + Main wagon "A" + Engine "B"

The nuance between them will become clearer as we learn more about particles, and as we get more input (immersion).

## Relative clauses

We learned how to modify/describe a noun by using the engine.

What is a *clause*? To put it in simple terms, a clause is basically a sentence that is inside another sentence. Let's recall our train analogy here.

Main wagon | Engine
:---: | :---:
A | B

In this analogy, there are 3 types of engines.

Engine name | Used for | Sentence type
:---: | :---: | :---:
う-engine | verb | A does B
だ-engine | noun | A is B
い-engine | adjective | A is B

Now, let's look at an example sentence.

- 美味しい。  
*Is delicious.*

Now let's say we want to describe a "cake" by saying "Delicious cake" (not to be confused with "cake is delicious"). We would say:

- 美味しいケーキ。  
*Delicious cake* (Lit: Cake that is delicious)

What if I want to say "cake that was bought at a bakery", we would say:

- パン屋さんで買ったケーキ。  
*Cake that was bought at a bakery*

In both sentences, 「美味しい」 and 「パン屋さんで買った」 are describing 「ケーキ」. And we can see that in Japanese, in both cases, that description is said *before* 「ケーキ」. However, in English the order of this "description" switches back and forth, depending on how long or complex the description is. In the first example, "*delicious*" was short and simple, so it is correct to say "*Delicious cake*". But in the second sentence, "*bought at a bakery*" is too long, and saying "*Bought at a bakery cake*" would be incorrect. We would have to say the description *after* "cake": "*Cake that was bought at a bakery*".

Let's look at another example where the "description" is long:

- 友達が先週本屋さんで買った本  
*Book that my friend bought at a book store last week*

The entire description is still said *before* 「本」 in Japanese. This is how Japanese works. Now let's go back to our question "*what is a clause?*" If we look at the "description" part, that sentence in itself is already a complete sentence.

main wagon "A" | に | で | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
友達が | 先週 | 本屋さんで | 買った

That entire sentence -or more precisely, *clause*- is describing the word that follows it: 「本」. So if we include the 「本」 into the train, it would look like this:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="4" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">Clause</th>
    <th rowspan="2" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">main wagon "A"</th>
    <th rowspan="2" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">main wagon "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">に</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">で</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">友達が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">先週</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">本屋さんで</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">買った</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">本</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">?</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Right now, the *clause* that describes 「本」 is a complete sentence in itself, but the entire sentence as a whole is not complete. Let's complete the sentence by adding the engine to it:

- 友達が先週本屋さんで買った本が面白い！  
*The book that my friend bought at a book store last week is interesting!*

Clause | main wagon "A" | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---:
友達が先週本屋さんで買った | 本が | 面白い！

or, it can also be visualized as such:

main wagon "A" | engine "B"
:---: | :---:
友達が先週本屋さんで買った本が | 面白い！

because in reality, the "clause" is just describing "A". The clause doesn't have a wagon of its own. Putting this train analogy aside, what's important is that this sentence is just an "A is B" sentence at the core, and we've simply added more details *about* "A". Let's highlight the "description" part, so we can more easily see that this sentence is really just "A is B" at its core.

- **友達が先週本屋さんで買った**本が面白い！  
*The book __that my friend bought at a book store last week__ is interesting!*

If we omit the description, the core of the sentence is really just "The book is interesting!" 「本が面白い！」.

This is the part where learning the 3 engines during the Sentence Structure section was crucial. Since we can describe any noun (in this case, a "book") by using a clause (which is a complete sentence on its own), then we can use any of the 3 engines to describe the noun.

Examples of **う-engines** clauses that describe a noun (I will highlight the clause in bold):

- **歩く**さくら  
*Sakura who walks*

- **友達が飲んだ**ジュース  
*Juice that friend drank*

- **走ってる**私  
*Me who is running* / *A running me*

- **休んでる**先生  
*Teacher who is taking a break* 

Let's look at examples of **い-engines** clauses that describe a noun:

- **美味しい**ケーキ  
*Delicious cake* / *Cake that is delicious*

- **美しい**姫  
*Beautiful princess* / *Princess that is beautiful*

- **赤い**ペン  
*Red pen* / *Pen that is red*

Let's look at examples of **だ-engines** clauses:

- ❌ 親切だ人

That is incorrect. The correct way of saying it is:

- ⭕ **親切な**人  
*Friendly people*

That's right. This is where the so called **"na-adjectives"** come from. The copula 「だ」 gets transformed into 「な」 when it is used to describe a word in this specific manner:

- 人は親切だ  
*People are friendly*

turns into:

- 親切な人  
*Friendly people* / *People that are friendly*

Now, the first sentence 「人は親切だ」 is a complete sentence. It is a sentence of type "A is B". But the second sentence is an incomplete sentence. It is merely saying "Friendly people".

Let's see some more examples of **だ-engines** clauses:

- **好きな**食べ物  
*Likeable food* / *Food that is liked*

- **有名な**人  
*Famous person* / *Person that is famous*

- **静かな**街  
*Quiet street* / *Street that is quiet*

- **便利な**場所  
*Convenient place* / *Place that is convenient*

- **上手な**学生  
*Skillful student* / *Proficient student* / *Student that is skillful*

- **必要な**書類  
*Necessary documents* / *Documents that are needed*

- **真面目な**後輩  
*Serious junior* / *Earnest junior* / *Junior who is serious*

### Word order

???+ warning

    **The order of the wagons doesn't really matter as long as the engine "B" is at the end. What matters is that the particles are attached to the correct word**. It is perfectly valid to say:

    - **「私がさくらにボールを投げる」**

    main wagon "A" + 「が」 | 「に」 wagon | 「を」 wagon | engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
    私が | さくらに | ボールを | 投げる

    and it means exactly the same thing as the previous sentence. **However if I changed the particles that the words are attached to, then the meaning of the sentence also changes**. For example:

    - **「私にボールをさくらが投げる」**

    「に」 wagon | 「を」 wagon | main wagon "A" + 「が」 | engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
    私に | ボールを | さくらが | 投げる

    This sentence means "Sakura throws the ball at me" or "Sakura throws the ball to me". If I say:

    - **「ボールが私にさくらを投げる」**

    main wagon "A" + 「が」 | 「に」 wagon | 「を」 wagon | engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
    ボールが | 私に | さくらを | 投げる

    This sentence means "The ball throws Sakura at me". 

In a previous section, when we learned about the particle 「は」, we aslo learned that:
> The order of the wagons doesn't really matter as long as the engine "B" is at the end. What matters is that the particles are attached to the correct word.

And this is mostly correct. I can say:

- 花を友達にあげる
- 友達に花をあげる

and they both mean exactly the same thing: "(I) give flowers to friend".

However, the order of the wagons doesn't matter **only if** the wagons stay inside their own clause. Let's look at the following example:

- 昨日泣いてた私が今日泣いている君を慰めている。  
*I, who was crying yesterday, is comforting you, who is crying today.*

In this sentence, we have two clauses that makes up the entire sentence.

Clause 1 | A | Clause 2 | を | B
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
昨日泣いてた | 私が | 今日泣いている | 君を | 慰めている。

Clause 1 is describing 「私」, clause 2 is describing 「君」.
