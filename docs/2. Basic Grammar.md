# Basic Grammar

## Main wagon "A"

Let's remind ourselves of our train  analogy:

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
- | -

Let's use these two sentences as examples:

- Sakura walks.
- Sakura is Japanese.

If we put those sentences into the train, they will look like this:

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
Sakura | walks
Sakura | is Japanese

However, in Japanese we need to mark "Sakura" as the main wagon "A". This is where we use the particle 「が」. **We attach 「が」 at the end of "Sakura" to mark "Sakura" as the main wagon "A"**, like so:

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
Sakura が | walks
Sakura が | is Japanese

!!! note
    We will learn more about **particles** in a later section.

### Invisible main wagon "A"

We learned that the core of a Japanese sentence is composed of:

Main wagon "A"  | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
- | -

However, you can't always see both of them. **You can always see the engine "B", but sometimes you can't see the main wagon "A"**. Why not? Because the main wagon became an invisible wagon. Even though you can't see it, it's still there. What is the invisible wagon? In English, the closest equivalent is the word "*it*". Let's begin by examining what "*it*" does in English. Let's look at the following sentence:

- The ball rolled down the hill. When the ball go to the bottom, the ball hit a sharp stone. The ball was punctured and all the air came out of the ball.

Would any native English speaker say it like that? Most likely not, because once we have established what we are talking about, we replace it with "*it*". So, a more natural way of saying the sentence would be:

- The ball rolled down the hill. When **it** got to the bottom, **it** hit a sharp stone. **It** was punctured and all the air came out of **it**.

Now, let's suppose a small child tries to say the same sentence but ends up saying:

- Ball rolled down hill, got to bottom, hit sharp stone, got punctured, all the air came out.

Is that difficult to understand? No, it's not. Because, in fact, we don't need to use the "*it*" marker everytime, over and over again. Technically speaking, English grammar demands it but there's no actual communicative need to do it. In Japanese grammar, "*it*" is not demanded at all. 

"*It*" by itself means nothing because it can mean anything. You will know what "*it*" is from context. If a small child came to the kitchen and said:

- Got really hungry. Came down to eat something.

there's nothing confusing or difficult about this. The child meant 

- **I** got really hungry. **I** came down to eat something.

In English, skipping the "I" is not a proper sentence, but in Japanese it is. All those English pronouns like "it", "she", "he", "I", "they", can be replaced by the invisible wagon **the zero-pronoun (Ø)** in Japanese. But the important thing to remember is that it is still there even though it's invisible. 

Alright, let's look at how this is done in Japanese. Suppose we want to say:

- I am Japanese.

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
I | am Japanese

To say that sentence in Japanese, it would be:

- 私が日本人だ。

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
私が | 日本人だ

However, it is perfectly valid to simply say:

- 日本人だ。

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
Øが | 日本人だ

The literal translation of 「日本人だ」 would be "is Japanese". The *full* sentence of 「日本人だ」 would be:

- Øが日本人だ。

and the zero-pronoun can be assumed to be "I" in this context. The zero-pronoun, just like the English word "it", will always have a different meaning based on context. For example, if we hear a rustling in the woods and look over in the direction of the rustles, and say:

- うさぎだ!

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
Øが | うさぎだ!

*Literal translation*: "is rabbit!"

In normal English, we would say "it is a rabbit!". What is "*it*"? Well, "*it*" in this context means "*that thing we just saw towards the rustling in the trees*". *That* is a rabbit. Another example is, let's say:

- 土曜日だ。

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
Ø が | 土曜日だ

*Literal translation*: "is Saturday"

Or in normal English, we would say "it is Saturday". What is "*it*"? "*It*" could mean "today". Or it could mean "tomorrow", or any other word, depending on the context.

All these sentences are complete Japanese sentences, with two parts: 1. the main wagon "A", and 2. the engine "B". In each of these cases, the main wagon is invisible - but it's still there.

This might sound like unecessary emphasis on the fact that the main wagon is still there even though it's invisible. However, the importance of this emphasis will become more apparent as sentences become more complex. Without a good understanding of this concept, complex sentences are going to start sounding extremely vague and hard to understand.

## Engine "B"

Let's remind ourselves of our train analogy:

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
- | -

and the fact that there are two types of sentences:

Sentence type | Example sentence
:---: | :---:
A does B | "Sakura walks"
A is B | "Sakura is Japanese"

This "Engine B" can be divided into three types:

Engine name | Used for | Sentence type
:---: | :---: | :---:
う-engine | verb | A does B
だ-engine | noun | A is B
い-engine | adjective | A is B

### 1. う-engine | Verbs

This engine is used for expressing sentences like "A does B", where "B" is an action -a verb-. A *verb* is a word used to describe an action, such as: walk, talk, learn, think, etc. Verbs in Japanese can be divided into two categories: __*ru-verbs*__ and __*u-verbs*__. All *ru-verbs* end in 「る」, while *u-verbs* can end in any kana with the *u-vowel* 「う」, including 「る」. Therefore, if a verb does **not** end in 「る」then it must be an *u-verb*.

!!! note
    Notice that all verbs end with an 「う」 u-vowel sound. Hence the name of this engine: the う-engine.

!!! tip
    **How to tell if a verb is *ru-verb* or *u-verb* if it ends in 「る」?**

    For verbs ending in 「る」, if the vowel sound preceding the 「る」 is an /a/, /u/ or /o/ vowel sound, it will **always** be an *u-verb*. Otherwise, if it is /i/ or /e/, it will be a *ru-verb* **in most cases**. If you're unsure which category a verb falls into, you can verify with most dictionaries.

    - Example of *u-verb*: 「分かる」（わかる）. The preceding kana of「る」is「か」, which has an /a/ vowel sound. Therefore it is an *u-verb*.
    - Example of *ru-verb*: 「食べる」（たべる）. The preceding kana of「る」is「べ」, which has an /e/ vowel sound. Therefore it is likely to be a *ru-verb*. It is, in fact, a *ru-verb*.
    - Example of *u-verb*: 「知る」（しる）. The preceding kana of「る」is「し」, which has an /i/ vowel sound. Therefore it is likely to be a *ru-verb*. However, it's actually an *u-verb*.

Examples:

Example of ru-verbs | Example of u-verbs | Irregular verbs
:---: | :---: | :---:
⾷べる | 分かる | する
⾒る | 話す | 来る
寝る | 聞く
起きる | 泳ぐ
考える | 遊ぶ
教える | 待つ
出る | 買う
いる | ある
着る | 死ぬ

It is important to make the distinction of *ru-verbs* vs *u-verbs* because they conjugate differently.

!!! warning "There are two irregular verbs"
    The verb: 「する」 and 「来る」 are considered as irregular. The reason is that these two verbs do not conjugate in quite the same way as the other two categories do. We will learn about conjugations in a later section.

An example sentence using this う-engine is:

- Sakura walks.

In this sentence, "A" is "Sakura" (the main wagon) and "B" is "walks" (the thing Sakura does; the engine of the sentence). In Japanese, "Sakura" is 「さくら」, and "walk" is「歩く」(あるく). To say **"Sakura walks"** in Japanese is:

- さくらが歩く。

Main wagon "A" | う-engine
:---: | :---:
さくらが | 歩く

Some example sentences using the う-engine are:

Japanese | English
:---: | :---:


### 2. だ-engine | Nouns

This engine is used for expressing sentences like "A is B", where "B" is a **noun**. A noun is a word used to identify a class of people, places, or things, such as: pencil, home, food, friend, person, Japanese person, American person, etc.

An example sentence using this だ-engine is:

- Sakura is a Japanese person.

In this sentence, "A" is "Sakura" and "B" is "is a Japanese person". "B" is telling us *what* "Sakura" is. We also need to express the word "**is**" from the sentence "_Sakura **is** a Japanese person_". To do that, we need the **copula**. In English, the word "be" (and its conjugation "am/is/are") is used as the copula. In Japanese, the hiragana 「だ」 is used as the copula (hence, we call this engine the だ-engine). So, to say "A is B" in Japanese, we attach 「だ」 at the end of "B" (*only* if "B" is a **noun**). 

In the previous example, "B" is "Japanese person" which is in fact a noun. In Japanese, "Japanese person" is 「日本人」(にほんじん). So, the previous example in Japanese would be:

- さくらが日本人だ。

Main wagon "A" | だ-engine
:---: | :---:
さくらが | 日本人だ

!!! info "Copula"
    A copula is a word that expresses a **one-way equality sign**.  
    
In the previous example "Sakura is a Japanese person", it is essentially saying:

- Sakura belongs to the set of Japanese people.
- Sakura is part of the set of Japanese people. 

To illustrate this one-way equality sign, it is helpful to think of 「だ」 as a person placing "A" into the set "B", like so:

![](copula.png){: width=300 }

In the previous example, "A" is "Sakura", and "B" is "Japanese person". So the copula 「だ」 is placing "Sakura" into the set of "Japanese people".

Some example sentences using the だ-engine are:

Japanese | English
:---: | :---:
ボブが声優だ。 | Bob is a voice actor.
私がアリスだ。 | I am Alice.
その人がアリスだ。 | That person is Alice.
私たちが学生だ。 | We are students.
先生が女の人だ。 | Teacher is a woman.
２が数字だ。 | 2 is a number.
トムが医者だ。 | Tom is a doctor.
日本人がアジア人だ。 | Japanese are Asians.

### 3. い-engine | Adjectives

This engine is also used for expressing sentences like "A is B", but "B" is an **adjective**. An adjective is a word that names an attribute that modifies or describes a noun, such as: sad, angry, happy, pretty, tall, difficult, easy, hot, cold, etc. We call this engine the い-engine because all adjectives in Japanese end with the kana 「い」. 

Here's a few examples of Japanese adjectives:

- 悲しい
- 安い
- 高い
- 温かい
- 冷たい
- 大きい

An example sentence using this い-engine is:

- Sakura is kind.

In this sentence, "A" is "Sakura", and "B" is "is kind". In Japanese, "kind" is 「優しい」(やさしい). To say **"Sakura is kind"** in Japanese is:

- さくらが優しい。

Main wagon "A" | い-engine
:---: | :---:
さくらが | 優しい

!!! warning "Be careful"
    Noticed that we don't have the copula 「だ」 on this sentence. 

!!! question "Why is 「だ」 missing?"
    Because 「優しい」 doesn't mean "kind", it means "is kind". **The copula is built into the adjective, which is the 「い」 part of the adjective.** 

!!! failure "Incorrect"
    If we say: 「さくらが優しいだ。」 then it would mean "Sakura is kind is", which is incorrect and makes no sense.

Some example sentences using the い-engine are:

Japanese | English
:---: | :---:
ペンが赤い。 | Pen is red.
ビルが高い。 | Building is tall.
天気が暑い。| Weather is hot.
脳が大きい。 | Brain is big.
学費が安い。 | Tuition is cheap.

## Use engine to describe noun

So far, we've learned how to express "A does B" and "A is B".

Example sentences are:

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
Sakura | walks.
Sakura | is Japanese.
Sakura | is shy.

However, we can use the engine to describe a noun, like so:

- Crying Sakura / Sakura who is crying
- Friendly Sakura / Sakura who is friendly
- Cute Sakura / Sakura who is cute

**Every engine can be used to describe a noun**. To do this in Japanese, we simply place the engine **before** the noun. Let's look at how this is done for each engine.

### 1. う-engine | Verbs

We know how to say:

- さくらが歩く。  
*Sakura walks.*

But if we want to describe Sakura by saying:

- Sakura who walks

then we place 「歩く」 before 「さくら」, like so:

- 歩くさくら

**Example 1**:

- ==泣いてる== さくらが悲しい。

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
==泣いてる== さくらが | 悲しい

In this sentence, 「泣いてる」 means "crying", and 「悲しい」 means "is sad". So, the full sentence reads:

- ==A crying== Sakura is sad.

Notice how we are using the verb "cry" to describe the noun "Sakura".

**Example 2**:

- ==運動した== 女の子が休んでる。

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
==運動した== 女の子が | 休んでる

In this sentence, 「運動した」 means "worked out / exercised", 「女の子」 means "girl", and 「休んでる」 means "resting". So, the full sentence reads:

- The girl ==who excersied== is resting.

Notice how we are using the verb "exercise" to describe the noun "Sakura".

**Example 3**:

- ==教科書を食べた== 犬がやんちゃだ。

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
==教科書を食べた== 犬が | やんちゃだ

In this sentence, 「教科書」 means "textbook", 「食べた」 means "ate", 「犬」 means "dog", and 「やんちゃ」 means "mischievous". So, the full sentence reads:

- The dog ==who ate the textbook== is mischievous.

Notice how we are using the verb "eat" to describe the noun "dog".

### 2. だ-engine | "na-adjectives"

We know how to say:

- さくらが親切だ。  
*Sakura is friendly.*

But if we want to describe Sakura by saying:

- Friendly Sakura / Sakura who is friendly

then we place 「親切」 before 「さくら」, like so:

- 親切なさくら

!!! warning "Pay attention to the kana 「な」"
    If we go back to the first sentence:

    - さくらが親切 ==だ==。

    the word 「親切」 is attached to the copula 「だ」. However, when we reverse the order by placing 「親切」 before the noun:
    
    - 親切 ==な== さくら
    
    the copula 「だ」 transforms 「な」. **「な」 is the connective form of the copula 「だ」.**

### 3. い-engine | "i-adjectives"

## Particles

Particles are one or more hiragana characters that attach to the end of a word to define the grammatical function of that word in the sentence. **This is why we represent each "word-particle" pair in the same wagon in our train analogy**. Using the correct particles is very important because the meaning of a sentence can completely change just by changing the particles. For example, the sentence "Eat fish."「魚を食べる」can become "The fish eats."「魚が食べる」 simply by changing one particle.

As a reminder, the relationship between Topic-Comment and Subject-Object can be visualized as such:

<table style="border: 1px solid black">
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">Topic</td>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Comment</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Main wagon</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Engine</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">X</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">A</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">B</td>
  </tr>
</table>

or a simpler visualization would be:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Topic</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">main wagon "A" + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black"> - </td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black"> - </td>
  </tr>
</table>

With this visualization/table in mind, let's learn some basic particles.

### 「は」

**「は」 is the topic particle**. To follow the analogy of our hypothetical train, **「は」is like a flag**. Why do we depict it as a flag? Because that's what it does. **It flags something as the topic of the sentence**. While the kana 「は」 is normally pronounced as /ha/, it is pronounced /wa/ only when it is being used as the topic particle.

Let's look at an example sentence:

- **「私は日本人だ」**

literally means "As for me, (I) am Japanese" or "Speaking of me, (I) am Japanese" or "In relation to me, (I) am Japanese". To visualize this, here's how it looks by using our train analogy:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">私は 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">main wagon "A" + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">engine "B" + だ</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">日本人だ</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The full sentence in Japanese is 「私はØが日本人だ」. The zero pronoun (Ø) means "I" in this context (we learned this in the "Sentence Structures" section). We marked 「私」 as the topic of our sentence by attaching the 「は」 particle to it. That same sentence in English would be:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">As for me 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">main wagon "A" + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">engine "B" + だ</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">I</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">am Japanese</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Now, you might ask yourself, "Isn't this overcomplicated? Can't we just pretend that 「私は」 is the main wagon "A" and translate the sentence as simply "I am Japanese?". The answer is **NO**. Although it works in this example sentence, it doesn't work in every case and that's why you shouldn't do it. When you run into sentences where "pretending that 「は」 is the main wagon" doesn't work, now you suddenly can't comprehend the sentence and you get lost.

To illustrate this, let's take a look at the following sentence:  
Note: 「うなぎ」 means "eel".  

*A group of friends are dining at a restaurant, and one person tells the waiter:*

- 「私はうなぎだ」

The joke is that the person has literally said "I am an eel". After all, if 「私は日本人だ」 means "I am Japanese", then 「私はうなぎだ」 must mean "I am an eel", right? That makes perfect sense, except that 「私は日本人だ」 doesn't actually mean "I am Japanese", it means "As for me, I am Japanese". This is why it is important to not assume that the "topic" is the main wagon "A". If we look at the train for 「私は日本人だ」:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">私は 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">main wagon "A" + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">engine "B" + だ</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">日本人だ</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Ø means "I" based on context (again, we learned this in the "Sentence Structures" section). However, in the case of 「私はうなぎだ」, the train looks like this:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">私は 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">main wagon "A" + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">engine "B" + だ</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">うなぎだ</td>
  </tr>
</table>

where Ø means "it". What is "it"? "It" is the thing we're talking about -the subject of the conversation-: *what we are eating for dinner*.

To better understand what the topic particle **does** and what it **doesn't do**, let's look at another example sentence without 「は」 and let's add in the 「を」 wagon.

Note: 「投げる」(なげる) means "throw"  
「ボール」 means "ball"

- **「私がボールを投げる」**

main wagon "A" + 「が」 | 「を」 wagon | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---:
私が | ボールを | 投げる

This sentence means "I throw a ball". The core sentence ("A" and "B") is "I throw" -「私が投げる」-. The non-core 「を」 wagon tells us *what I threw*. It was a ball. Let's introduce one more wagon into the train: the 「に」 wagon.

- **「私がボールをさくらに投げる」**

main wagon "A" + 「が」 | 「を」 wagon | 「に」 wagon | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
私が | ボールを | さくらに | 投げる

This sentence means "I throw a ball at Sakura" or "I throw a ball to Sakura". All three particles in this sentence -「が」,「を」and 「に」 tell us what is happening to each word that it's attached to. 「が」 tells us *who* threw the ball, 「を」 tells us *what* was thrown, 「に」 tells us *to whom* the ball was thrown.

**The order of the wagons doesn't really matter as long as the engine "B" is at the end. What matters is that the particles are attached to the correct word**. It is perfectly valid to say:

- **「私がさくらにボールを投げる」**

main wagon "A" + 「が」 | 「に」 wagon | 「を」 wagon | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
私が | さくらに | ボールを | 投げる

and it means exactly the same thing as the previous sentence. **However if I changed the particles that the words are attached to, then the meaning of the sentence also changes**. For example:

- **「私にボールをさくらが投げる」**

「に」 wagon | 「を」 wagon | main wagon "A" + 「が」 | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
私に | ボールを | さくらが | 投げる

This sentence means "Sakura throws the ball at me" or "Sakura throws the ball to me". If I say:

- **「ボールが私にさくらを投げる」**

main wagon "A" + 「が」 | 「に」 wagon | 「を」 wagon | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
ボールが | 私に | さくらを | 投げる

This sentence means "The ball throws Sakura at me". 

Now that we've seen how those particles can affect the "role" of a word, let's introduce the 「は」 particle into the sentence to see what a topic particle does to the sentence.

- **「私はさくらにボールを投げる」**

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="4" style="text-align: center">私は 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">"A" wagon + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">「に」 wagon</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">「を」 wagon</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">さくらに</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">ボールを</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">投げる</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This means "As for me, (I) throw the ball at Sakura". Now let's give the 「は」 flag to the "ball".

- **「ボールは私がさくらに投げる」**

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="4" style="text-align: center">ボールは 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">"A" wagon + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">「に」 wagon</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">「を」 wagon</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">私が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">さくらに</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø を</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">投げる</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This means "As for the ball, I throw (it) at Sakura". 

Notice how the logical meaning of the sentence doesn't change at all. That is because the **「は」 particle is a topic particle**. Let us remind ourselves of the relationship between Topic-Comment and Structure-Object.

<table style="border: 1px solid black">
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">Topic</td>
    <th colspan="4" style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Comment</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Main wagon</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Engine</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">「に」</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">「を」</th>    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">ボールは</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">私が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">さくらに</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Ø を</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">投げる</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The "Topic" simply brings something up as... well, the topic of the conversation. It doesn't tell us anything *about* the topic. That's what the "Comment" is there for. The "Comment" is what tells us logical information. This is why the "Topic" doesn't change the logical meaning of the sentence -the logical meaning of the "Comment"-.

**It is important to note that giving the 「は」 flag to a word can change the nuance of the sentence every so slightly**, but we don't have to worry about it for now. We will have a deeper look at these nuances in a later section.

---

**How do native speakers use 「は」?**  
It is very common for native speakers to drop almost all the words in a sentence or question, to keep it as short as possible. The unspoken part of the sentence is expected to be inferred by the listener based on context.

For example, a person might ask a roommate in English:

**"What should we eat for dinner?"**

But for a Japanese speaker, they can ask the same question by saying:

Note: 「夕飯」 means "dinner"

- **「夕飯は？」**

The literal translation is *"As for dinner?"*. Of course, the actual complete sentence (though not said out loud) can be something like:

- **「夕飯は何にする？」**

Which can be roughly translated as *"As for dinner, what should we eat?"*.

Let's look at another dialogue:  

Note: 「今夜」（こんや）means "tonight"  
「空いてる」（あいてる）means "free" (as in "available" or "have time")  
「残念」（ざんねん）means "unfortunate"  
「俺」means "I" (masculine tone)

*Suppose that two friends want to go try out a new restaurant that just opened up*  
**アリス：「私は今夜空いてるよ。ボブさんは？」**  
**ボブ：「残念。俺は今夜忙しいんだ」**

*Literal translation (not quite literal, but I tried my best)*  
**Alice: As for me, (I) am free tonight. As for Bob?**  
**Bob: Unfortunate. As for me, (I) am busy tonight.**

*Natural English*  
**Alice: I am free tonight. What about you?**  
**Bob: That's unfortunate. I'm busy tonight.**

Notice how Alice says 「ボブさんは？」 which literally means *"As for Bob?"*. When Alice first started her sentence, she said 「私は。。。」 which means *"As for me..."*. This means that the current topic is "Alice". By using the 「は」 particle again when she asked 「ボブさんは？」, she has now changed the topic. Changing the topic in this paritcular way in this particular context implies *"What about you (Bob)?"*.

The complete question would be 「ボブさんは今夜空いてる？」 which means *"As for Bob, are (you) free tonight?"*. You can see that even in English, asking "What about you?" was enough to convey the meaning of the whole question without actually saying it out loud.

Let's look at another dialogue as example:

Note: 「明日」（あした）means "tomorrow"

**アリス：リエさんは明日？**  
**ボブ：ううん、明日じゃない。**

*Literal translation*  
**Alice: As for Rie, tomorrow?**  
**Bob: No, not tomorrow.**

Since we don't have enough context, we don't have enough information to make sense of this conversation. Given a context, as long as the sentence has something to do with "Rie" and "tomorrow", it can mean anything. For instance, they could be talking about when Rie is taking an exam.

Let's look at another example:

Note: 「試験」（しけん）means "exam"

**アリス： 今⽇は試験だ。**  
**ボブ： ジョンは？**  
**アリス： ジョンは明⽇。**

*Literal translation*  
**Alice: In relation to today, (it) is exam.**  
**Bob: As for John?**  
**Alice: As for John, (it is) tomorrow.**

*Natural English*  
**Alice: Today is the exam.**  
**Bob: What about John?**  
**Alice: John will take it tomorrow.**

This example shows how generic the topic of a sentence can be. A topic can be referring to any action or object from anywhere even including other sentences. For example, in the last sentence 「ジョンは明⽇」, even though the sentence is about when the exam is for John, the word "exam" doesn't appear anywhere in the sentence!

Let's look at another example:

**ボブ： アリスは学⽣？**  
**アリス： うん、学⽣。**

*Literal translation*  
**Bob: As for Alice, are (you) a student?**  
**Alice: Yes, (I) am a student.**

*Natural English*  
**Bob: Are you a student?**  
**Alice: Yeas, I am.**

Here, Bob is marking "Alice" as the topic when he asked 「アリスは学⽣？」. Notice that once the topic is established, Alice does not have to repeat the topic to answer the question about herself. We know that the zero pronoun is "Alice" based on context. The full sentence from Alice is 「うん、私はØが学生だ。」. 

The 「は」 particle has other properties and nuances, but we will look at them in a later section when we compare 「は」 with 「が」.

### 「も」

**「も」 is the inclusive topic particle**. It is essentially the topic particle with the additional meaning of "also". Basically, it can introduce another topic in addition to the current topic. Its usage is best explained by an example.

**Example 1**

ボブ： アリスは学⽣？  
アリス： うん、トム**も**学⽣。

*Literal translation*  
Bob: As for Alice, are (you) a student?  
Alice: Yes. As for Tom **also**, (he) is a student.

*Natural English*  
Bob: Are you a student?  
Alice: Yeah, and Tom is **also** student.

The inclusion of 「も」 must be consistent with the answer. It would not make sense to say, "I am a student, and Tom is also not a student." Instead, use the 「は」 particle to make a break from the inclusion, i.e. change the topic. Let's look at the next example.

**Example 2**

ボブ： アリスは学⽣？  
アリス： うん、でもトムは学⽣じゃない。

*Literal translation*  
Bob: As for Alice, are (you) a student?  
Alice: Yes, but, as for Tom, (he) is not.

*Natural English*  
Bob: Are you a student?  
Alice: Yeah, but Tom is not.

If the inclusion *is* consistent with the answer, then we can use 「も」.

**Example 3**

ボブ：アリスは学⽣？  
アリス：ううん、トム**も**学⽣じゃない。

*Literal trasnlation*  
Bob: As for Alice, are (you) a student?  
Alice: No, as for Tom **also**, (he) is not a student.

*Natural English*  
Bob: Are you a student?  
Alice: No, Tom is **also** not student.

### 「は」 vs 「も」

**Be careful how you use 「は」 and 「も」 in certain phrases.**

For example, the following phrase is often said when greeting someone during New Year:

Note: 「今年」（ことし）＝ this year

- ⭕ 「今年**も**よろしくお願いします。」
- ❌ 「今年**は**よろしくお願いします。」

A very rough translation of this phrase in English can be 

- "Once again this year, please be good to me"
- "Once again this year, I'm looking forward to working with you". 

Notice that the correct way of saying the phrase is using **「も」**, because you want to say "this year too". However, if you used **「は」** instead, you will be saying "As for this year, I'm looking forward to working with you". This implies that your relationship with that person in "previous years" were not a successful one. It implies that the relationship was not pleasant for you. You're esseentially saying, "This year, **as opposed to previous years**, I'll be looking forward to working with you", which is very rude.

### 「が」

**「が」 is the identifier particle**. What do I mean by that? So far, it seems like in Japanese, we tend to say the topic (with 「は」), and then the main wagon "A" (with 「が」) becomes an invisible one. So when should we use the 「が」 particle for the main wagon "A"? Let's say we don't know what the topic is. Let's say I want to ask "Who is the student?". If I use the topic particle 「は」, the question would become 

Note: 「誰」（だれ） means "who"

- **「誰は学生？」**

*"As for who, is (it) a student?"*

and that doesn't make any sense because "who" is not an actual person. This is where 「が」 comes into play.

A reminder of our train analogy:

Main wagon | Engine
:---: | :---:
A | B

What we need in this case is an **"identifier"** because I don't know who the student is. We want to *identify* who is the student. So if I ask "Who is the student?", it means that the main wagon "A" is **unknown**, and the engine "B" is "student". To illustrate:

main wagon "A" + が | engine "B"
:---: | :---:
? が | 日本人

So, all we need to do is put 「誰」 in the main wagon. The question now becomes:

- **「誰が学生？」**

*Who is student?*

Makes sense right? The 「が」 particle -as explained in previous sections- marks the main wagon "A". It marks the subject. It marks the doer. It tells us *who*/*what* is doing/being "B". But earlier we said that we needed an *identifier*. Does that mean that the 「が」 particle is an identifier? Absolutely. Let's think about it. The 「が」 particle marks the main wagon "A", therefore it tells us *who*/*what* is doing/being "B". It **identifies** "A" for us.

Let's look at an example:

- **ボブ：誰が学⽣？**  
*Bob: Who is the one that is student?*  

- **アリス：ジョンが学⽣。**  
*Alice: John is the one who is student*

Bob wants to identify *who* -among all the possible candidates- is a student. Alice responds that John is the one. Notice, Alice could also have answered with the topic particle to indicate that, "Speaking of John", she knows that he is **a** student (maybe not **the** student). You can see the difference in the next two sentences.

- **ボブ：誰が学⽣？**  
*Bob: Who is the one that is student?*  
- **アリス：ジョンが学⽣。**  
*Alice: John is the one who is student.*

--- OR ---

- **アリス：ジョンは学⽣。**  
*Alice: As for John, (he) is student. (As for other people, they could be student too)*

The first answer seeks to identify a *specific* person for "student" while the second answer is simply talking about a student. I often translate the 「は」 particle as "as for; about; speaking of; in relation to" and the 「が」 particle as "the one; the thing" to illustrate the difference.

Let's look at one more example:

1. **私は学⽣。**  
**As for me, (I am) student.**

2. **私が学⽣。**  
**I (am) the one (that is) student.**

The 「は」 and 「が」 particles are actually quite different if you think of it the right way. The 「が」 particle identifies a specific entity as *the* thing while the 「は」 particle is used only to bring up a new topic of conversation. This is why, in longer sentences, it is common to separate the topic with commas to remove ambiguity about which part of the sentence the topic applies to.

### 「は」 vs 「が」

Now that we learned about the grammatical usage of 「は」 and 「が」, it might still be a little bit confusing for some people. Unlike English, which is a very Subject-Object oriented language, Japanese is a very Topic-Comment oriented language. This is why you see 「は」 more often than 「が」 in a normal sentence like "A is B".

Let's explain the difference between 「は」 and 「が」 again, but not from a grammar standpoint, but from a conversation standpoint. *How do native speakers use those particles?*

Let's start by asking ourselves "If 「は」 and 「が」 are similar, then why are there two different particles with seemingly the same usage?" The answer is: because there are times when we want to say "this is different compared to other things".

For example, grammatically speaking, the following two sentences are correct.

Note: 「これ」＝ this  
「携帯」（けいたい）＝ cellphone

- これ**は**携帯だ。  
- これ**が**携帯だ。

Both sentences are generally translated the same way into English: "This is a cellphone".

But the one that is used more often is 「これは携帯だ」. When you want to say that *something* is different compared to *other things*, you use 「が」. If there is literally only one cellphone in the entire world, saying 「これが携帯だ」 would be incorrect, because there are no other cellphones to compare it with.

**「が」 is really only used when you are making a comparison**. For example, the following two sentences:

- ⭕ 誰**が**学⽣？
- ❌ 誰**は**学⽣？

The question is asking "Who is a student?".

The first question 「誰が学⽣？」 is grammatically correct, while the second question 「誰は学⽣？」 is not. In this example, there are many people who could be a student, and you want to know *who* is a student among them. You are comparing all those people to each other, and then choosing one person and saying "*that* is the student". Comparing in this manner is the only way 「が」 is used. This is why if you use 「が」 in a normal statement like "A is B", **it can sound very bossy**.

For example, normally you say:

Note: 「医学生」（いがくせい）＝ medical student

- 私**は**医学生だ。

but if you say this instead:

- 私**が**医学生だ。

you will end up sounding like you're trying to say *"He's not a medical student. She's also not a medical student. Then who is a medical student? That's right. __I am__ a medical student. I'm differrent from the other students"*. You will end up putting too much emphasis on 「私」 and sounding very rude.

This is also why during self-introduction, you should say:

- 私**は**さくらだ。  
(This still sounds unnatural and disrespectful, but for other reasons that we haven't looked at yet)

However, if you say this during self-introduction:

- 私**が**さくらだ。

you will end up sounding like "I am *the* Sakura. I am *the* Sakura that *everyone knows about*. That's *me*".

The next example might look like it's contradicting this rule. Let's have a look:

Note: 「昔々」（むかしむかし）＝ once upon a time / long time ago  
「姫」（ひめ）＝ princess  
「美しい」（うつくしい）＝ beautiful

- 「昔々姫**が**いた。姫**は**美しかった。」  
*Once upon a time, there was a princess. The princess was beautiful.*

Notice that in the first sentence 「が」 was used, and in the second sentence 「は」 was used. But didn't we just learn that 「が」 is used for comparison? So who are we comparing 「姫」 to? We are essentially saying: 

*"Once upon a time, there was a __princess__. Not a prince, not a queen, not a farmer, but a princess. The princess is the focus of the story".*

The princess is someone we didn't know yet. We were introducing her for the first time. After introducing the princess in the story, now we *know* who she is, so now we can say 「姫は。。。」 in the second sentence to mean "As for the princess, ...". If we don't first introduce the princess in the first sentence and go straight to the second sentence "As for the princes, ...", you as the reader might wonder "*As for the princess? What princess? Which princess are we talking about specifically?*".

Another way to look at the difference between 「は」 and 「が」 is that 「は」 puts the emphasis on the sentence after it, while 「が」 puts the emphasis on the sentence before it. This makes sense if we look at what we learned at the beginning of this section:
> Japanese is a very Topic-Comment oriented language

which is why using 「は」 is the particle that's normally used, while using 「が」 is only for comparison and/or emphasis.

To illustrate this change of emphasis, let's look at the following 3 sentences:

Note: 「本」（ほん）＝ book  
（買う）（かう）＝ buy

1. 本を買った。
2. 私は本を買った。
3. 私が本を買った。

In the **first sentence**, it doesn't put any particular emphasis on anything; it's just saying, neutrally, "I bought a book". 

If we choose to stress "I" as the topic and say the **second sentence**, we're making 「私」 into "old information", and 「本を買った」 into "new information". Remember that 「は」 establishes the topic of the sentence, so when we choose to say it explicitly, we're "establishing a new topic", or "changing the topic". Establishing a new topic, in most cases, can also mean changing the topic, because we can assume that there was some topic before. So, in the second sentence, we're changing the topic to "I" and saying that "I bought a book". The particle 「は」, aside from marking something as the topic, it also implies that the "*comment*" on said topic is different from the comment on "old topics" or on "other topics". In other words, the second sentence is essentially saying "*What I did was to buy a book. You may have bought something else. Other people may not have bought anything at all, but what __I__ did was to buy a book*". This means that it is implicitly answering the question "*What did I do?*" The answer is "I *bought a book*".

Now, if we say the **third sentence**, we've now changed the emphasis. You've reversed the emphasis. The "old information" is now "bought a book" and the "new information" is "I". So under what circumstances do we say the third sentence? Suppose that people are looking at an empty bookshelf and wondering who bought the last book, and you say 「私**が**本を買った」. In other words, you're saying "*I am the one* who bought the book". We all know and see that the bookshelf is empty, so "buying the book" is "old information". People want to know the "new information"; people want to know **who** bought the book, which is why you should answer with 「私**が**本を買った」. While the second sentence is implicitly answering the question "*What did I do?*", the third sentence is implicitly answering the question "*Who bought the book?*".

In a certain way, 「は」 works like the English word "*the*", but only in this one respect, that it can't mark new information. To illustrate this "old information" vs "new information" concept, let's look at some examples of the English word "the". If we say:

- I fed the iguana.

unless people already know about this iguana, their immediate thought is going to be "What iguana? You never talked about any iguana before. What do you mean *the* iguana?". But if we say:

- I fed an iguana.

that's alright. However, you can in fact say:

- I fed the dog.

without anybody knowing that you even had a dog, because it's very *normal and natural* for a person to have a dog. It not necessary to "introduce" the dog into the conversation first to then say "the dog". But if I said "I fed the iguana", that's a conversation stopper, isn't it? If you don't introduce the iguana first, nobody is just going to assume that you have an iguana at home as pet, because it's not common. So, while we say "new information" vs "old information", it's actually a bit more subtler than that. It's actually "new, important and relevant information" vs "old information or information that can be commonly agreed on".

Another example I would like to bring up is this: let's say you are with a friend who has never seen what a ramen looks like. There are three dishes in front of you two: sushi, curry rice, and ramen. When you point at the ramen to let your friend know that *that* is ramen, you can say:

- あれ**が**ラーメン

Using 「が」 in this manner implies "That (sushi) is not ramen. That (curry rice) is also not ramen. *That* (ramen) is ramen". However, usually when you're just explaining what a ramen is, you should use 「は」.

Another example that might not seem as straightforward to understand is this sentence:

- 私**が**高校生の時サッカーが好きだった

This sentence roughly translates to "I liked playing soccer when I was in highschool". This sentence might look too complicated for someone who just started learning Japanese. But the point I want to make is that 「が」 was used in the sentence, instead of 「は」. But earlier we learned that
> 「が」 is really only used when you are making a comparison.

so who are we comparing 「私」 to? We are comparing "myself" to "myself". More accurately, we are comparing the "present me" to the "past me" or "the highschool me".

「は」 and 「が」 can also mark particularities as opposed to generalities. For example, if we say:

- 花**は**きれいだ

it's likely that we're saying flowers in general. But if we say:

- 花**が**きれいだ

we're stressing 「花」 as the subject, and this means 

- "The flower/these flowers in particular is/are pretty."

One last thing that I would like to bring up is that, even native speakers will sometimes (although very rarely) use the incorrect particle. Therefore, it is *very very* common to hear native speakers ommit the particle in conversations, like this:

- 私、さくらだ。
- 私、医学生だ。

The difference between these two particles will become more apparent and easier to tell apart as you do more *immersion* (if you don't know what I mean by immersion, refer back to the Getting Started section).

### 「を」

**「を」 is the direct object particle**. It marks the direct object of a transitive verb (we will learn about transitive and intransitive verbs in a later section). Essentially, it marks *what* the verb is *"verb"'ing* to. The kana 「を」 is essentially never used anywhere else. That is why the katakana equivalent 「ヲ」 is almost never used since particles are always written in hiragana. The 「を」 kana, while technically pronounced as /wo/ essentially sounds like /o/ in real speech. Here are some examples of the direct object particle in action.

Note: 「魚」（さかな） means "fish" 
「食べる」（たべる）＝ eat  
「ジュース」 means "juice"  
「飲む」（のむ）＝ drink

1. **⿂を⾷べる。**  
**Eat fish.**

2. **ジュースを飲む。**  
**Drink juice.**

In the first sentence, the verb is 「食べる」 which means "eat". *What* is being eaten? The 「魚」.  
In the second sentence, the verb is 「飲む」 which means "drink". *What* is being drunk? The 「ジュース」.

Unlike the direct object in English, places can also be the direct object of motion verbs such as 「歩く」（あるく）(walk) and 「⾛る」（はしる）(run). Since the motion verb is done **to** the location, the concept of direct object is the same in Japanese. However, as you can see by the next examples, it often translates to something different in English due to the slight difference of the concept of direct object.

Note: 「街」（まち） means "street"  
「ぶらぶら」 means "aimlessly"  
「⾼速道路」（こうそくどうろ） means "expressway" or "highway"

1. **街をぶらぶら歩く。**  
**Aimlessly walk through street. (Lit: Aimlessly walk street)**

2. **⾼速道路を⾛る。**  
**Run through expressway. (Lit: Run expressway)**

3. **家を出る。**  
**Leave the house. (Lit: Exit house)**

### 「に」

**「に」 is the indirect object particle**. It indicates the recipient of an action. This is different from the 「を」 particle in which the verb does something **to** the direct object. With the 「に」 particle, the verb does something **toward** the word associated with the 「に」 particle. For example, the target of any motion verb is specified by the 「に」 particle.

Note: 「日本」（にほん） means "Japan"  
「行く」（いく） means "go"  
「家」（いえ） means "home"  
「帰る」（かえる） means "return back" (specifically to home)  
「部屋」（へや） means "room"  
「来る」（くる） means "come"  

1. **ボブは⽇本に⾏く。**  
**Bob goes to Japan.**

2. **家に帰る。**  
**Go back home.**

3. **部屋に来る。**  
**Come to room.**

4. **さくらにボールを投げる。**  
**Throw ball at Sakura. / Throw ball to Sakura.**

The idea of a target in Japanese is very general and is not restricted to motion verbs. For example, **the location of an object** is defined as the target of the verb for existence (ある and いる). **Time** is also a common target. Here are some examples of non-motion verbs and their targets.

Note: 「猫」（ねこ）＝ cat  
「椅子」（いす）＝ chair  
「台所」（だいどころ）＝ kitchen  
「友達」（ともだち）＝ friend  
「会う」（あう）＝ meet  
「医者」（いしゃ）＝ doctor  
「なる」（なる）＝ become  
「来週」（らいしゅう）＝ next week  
「一時」（いちじ）＝ one o'clock  
「昼ご飯」（ひるごはん）＝ lunch  
「食べる」（たべる）＝ eat

1. **猫は部屋にいる。**  
**Cat is in room.**

2. **いすが台所にある。**  
**Chair is in the kitchen.**

3. **友達に会う。**  
**Meet a friend.**

4. **ジムは医者になる。**  
**Jim becomes doctor.**

5. **来週に図書館に⾏った。**  
**Go to library next week.**

6. **一時に昼ご飯を食べる。**  
**Eat lunch at one o'clock.**

*Note: Don't forget to use 「ある」 for inanimate objects and 「いる」 for animate objects. We will learn about these two verbs in a later section "Copula vs Exist"*

While the 「に」 particle is not always required to indicate time, there is a slight difference in meaning between using the target particle and not using anything at all. In the following examples, the target particle makes the date a specific target **emphasizing** that the friend will go to Japan at that time. Without the particle, there is no special emphasis.

Note: 「来年」（らいねん）＝ next year

1. 友達は、来年、⽇本に⾏く。  

2. 友達は、来年**に**⽇本に⾏く。  

### 「から」 and 「まで」

In the previous section we learned about the target particle 「に」, which always targets "to" rather than "from". If you wanted to say, "come **from**" for example, you would need to use **「から」**, which means "from". If you used **「に」**, it would instead mean "come **to**". 「から」 is also often paired with **「まで」**, which means "**up to**" or "**until**".

Note: 「アメリカ」 means "America"  
「宿題」（しゅくだい） means "homework"

1. **アリスは、アメリカから来る。**  
**Alice comes from America.**

2. **宿題を今⽇から明⽇までする。**  
**Do homework from today until tomorrow.**

### 「へ」

**「へ」 is the directional particle**. It indicates motion to a location. While 「へ」 is normally pronounced /he/, when it is being used as a particle, it is always pronounced /e/ (え). 

The primary difference between the 「に」 and 「へ」 particle when used with motion verbs is that 「に」 goes to a target as the final, intended destination (both physical or abstract). The 「へ」 particle, on the other hand, is used to express the fact that one is setting out towards the direction of the target. As a result, it is only used with directional motion verbs. It also does not guarantee whether the target is the final intended destination, only that one is heading towards that direction. In other words, the 「に」 particle sticks to the destination while the 「へ」 particle is fuzzy about where one is ultimately headed. For example, if
we choose to replace 「に」 with 「へ」 in the examples from the section about 「に」 particle, the nuance changes slightly.

1. ボブは⽇本**へ**⾏く。  
Bob heads **towards** Japan.

2. 家**へ**帰る。  
Go back **toward** house.

3. 部屋**へ**来る。  
Come **towards** room

Note that we cannot use the 「へ」 particle with verbs that have no physical direction. For example, the following is incorrect.

- ❌ **医者へなる。**  
(Grammatically incorrect version of 「医者になる」.)

This does not mean to say that 「へ」 cannot set out towards an abstract concept. In fact, because of the fuzzy directional meaning of this particle, the 「へ」 particle can also be used to talk about setting out towards certain future goals or expectations.

Note: 「勝ち」（かち）＝ victory  
「向かう」（むかう）＝ to face / to go towards / to head towards

- **勝ちへ向かう。**  
**Go towards victory**

### 「で」

**「で」 is the contextual/boundary particle**. It allows us to specify the context or boundary in which the action is performed. It can also be called the instrumental particle. It is used to indicate *what* is the "instrument" or "means by" or "with which" the subject achieves or accomplishes an action. For example, if a person ate a fish, where did he eat it? If a person went to school, by what means did she go? With what will you eat the soup? All of these questions can be answered with the 「で」 particle. Here are some examples.

1. **映画館で⾒た。**  
_Saw (a movie) **at** the movie theater._  
(The action "see a movie" was done within the boundaries of a movie theather.)

2. **バスで帰る。**  
_Go home **by** bus._  
(The action "go home" was done within the boundaries of a "bus".)

3. **レストランで昼ご飯を⾷べた。**  
_Ate lunch **at** restaurant._  
(The action "eat lunch" was done within the boundaries of a "restaurant".)

4. **愛でご飯を作る。**  
_Make food **with** love._    
(The action "make food" is done by the means of "love".)

5. **一人で泣いた。**  
_(I/He/She) cried **by** myself/himself/herself._  
(The action "cry" was done within the boundaries of "oneself". No one else was inside that boundary.)

6. **世界で一番高いビル。**  
_Tallest building **in** the world._  
(The "building" is within the boundaries of "world".)

7. **全国で一番高いビル。**  
_Tallest building **in** the nation/country._  
(The "building" is within the boundaries of "nation/country". We're not talking about buildings that are ousdie of the country. We're only talking about bulidings within the country.)

8. **みんなで行く。**  
_Go **with** everyone._  
(The action "go" is done within the boundaries of "everyone".)

9. **お箸で食べる。**  
_Eat **with** chopsticks._  
(the action "eat" is done with the instrument "chopsticks".)

### 「の」

**「の」 is the noun modifier particle**. It marks a word (usually a noun) as modifying another word (also usually another noun), thus indicating an attributive relationship of one noun to the other noun. 

- ボブは、アメリカの⼤学の学⽣だ。  
Lit: Bob is student of college of America.

In normal English, this would translate to, "Bob is a student of an American college." The order of modification is backwards so "Bob is a student of a college that is American". In this example, 「⼤学」 is modifying 「学⽣」, and 「アメリカ」 is modifying 「⼤学」.

The particle 「の」 can also be used as a possessive particle. The equivalent of this specific usage in English is the apostrophe *'s*.

- ボブの本  
Bob's book / Book of Bob

- 私の本  
My book / Book of mine

- 私の友達
My friend / Friend of mine

The noun that is being modified (i.e. the word after the 「の」) can be omitted if the context clearly indicates what is being omitted. The following words in bold can be omitted.

1. そのシャツは誰の**シャツ**？  
Whose shirt is that shirt?

2. ボブの**シャツ**だ。  
It is shirt of Bob. / It is Bob's shirt.

to become:

1. そのシャツは誰**の**？  
Whose shirt is that?

2. ボブ**の**だ。  
It is of Bob. / It is Bob's.

Another example of omission is to change this:

1. パソコン壊れた？  
*Did your computer break?*

2. うん、でも新しい**パソコン**を買った。  
_Yeah, but I bought a new **computer**._

into this:

1. パソコン壊れた？  
*Did your computer break?*

2. うん、でも新しい**の**を買った。  
_Yeah, but I bought a new **one**._

More examples of omission:

1. ケーキ食べてみた？  
_Did you try the cakes?_

2. うん。イチゴ**の**は美味しかったけど、チョコ**の**はあんまり。  
_Yeah. The strawberry **one** was delicious but the chocolate **one** not so much._

## Copula vs Exist

So far, we learned that saying "A **is** B" in Japanese is 「AはBだ」. An example is:

- **私はさくらだ。**  
I **am** Sakura.

However, if we want to say "I **am** at home", or "I **am** at school", we cannot say:

- ❌ **私は家だ。**  
**I am home.** (Lit: As for me, (I) am a house)
- ❌ **私は学校だ。**  
**I am school.** (Lit: As for me, (I) am a school)

What is going on here? The problem is that, in English, the **copula** and the verb "**to be**" are the *same word*. When you say this in English:

"Sakura **is** over there"

you're not saying "Sakura **is** literally *a place*"; you're saying "Sakura **exists** in that place", "Sakura is **being** in that place". Japanese is not the only language that separates the copula and the verb "to be" into different words. Spanish also does it. For example, if you want to say "I **am** Sakura" in Spanish you would say:

"Yo **soy** Sakura"  

"soy" is the present singular first-person conjugation of the Spanish copula "**ser**". But if you want to say "I **am** at school" in Spanish, you would say:

"Yo **estoy** en la escuela"

"estoy" is the present singular first-person conjugation of the Spanish verb "to be" which is "**estar**".

**So how do we say "to be" in Japanese?**  
We say **「いる」** for animate objects, and **「ある」** for inanimate objects.

**BIG DISCLAIMER HERE**: separating 「いる」 and 「ある」 into animate and inanimate objects, respectively, is not always true. But we can use this as a general rule of thumb.

Animate objects are things that have life: humans, animals, etc.  
Inanimate objects are things that don't.

For example:

- 教室に椅子が**ある**  
*The chairs __are__ in the classroom* / *There __are__ chairs in the classroom*
- 机の上に鉛筆が**ある**  
*The pencil __is__ on the desk* / *There __is__ a pencil on the desk*
- 教室にジョンさんが**いる**  
*John __is__ in the classroom*
- 庭に犬が**いる**  
*The dog __is__ in the garden* / *There __is__ a dog in the garden*
- 猫は部屋に**いる。**  
*The cat __is__ in the room.* / *There __is__ a cat in the room*

Now let's look at some examples where the aforementioned rule doesn't apply.

- ❌ チューリップがいる
- ⭕ チューリップがある  
*There is a Tulip*

So, plants can't be used with 「いる」? Then it just seems like the rule should be "things that move" vs "things that don't move", right? Not true either. Let's look at the following sentences:

- ❌ 人形がある
- ⭕ 人形がいる  
*There is a doll*
- ⭕ 電車がある 
- ⭕ 電車がいる  
*There is a train*
- ⭕ タクシーがある
- ⭕ タクシーがいる  
*There is a taxi*
- ⭕ バスがある
- ⭕ バスがいる  
*There is a bus*
- ⭕ トラックがある
- ⭕ トラックがいる  
*There is a truck*
- ⭕ フィギュアがある
- ❌ フィギュアがいる  
*There is a figurine*
- ⭕ 扇風機がある
- ❌ 扇風機がいる  
*There is an electric fan*
- ⭕ シーリングファンがある
- ❌ シーリングファンがいる  
*There is a ceiling fan*

Vehicles (in the broadest sense of the word) such as trains, cars, boats, etc, are generally used with 「いる」 because there are *people* inside those vehicles. Of course, vehicles can be used with 「ある」 as well, but the nuance changes slightly. Generally speaking, it is ok to simply use 「いる」 for humans and animals, and 「ある」 for the rest. If an exception comes up, like the ones you see above, then you just have to memorize and get used to those few exceptions.

## Relative clauses

We learned how to modify/describe a noun by using the engine.

What is a *clause*? To put it in simple terms, a clause is basically a sentence that is inside another sentence. Let's recall our train analogy here.

Main wagon | Engine
:---: | :---:
A | B

In this analogy, there are 3 types of engines.

Engine name | Used for | Sentence type
:---: | :---: | :---:
う-engine | verb | A does B
だ-engine | noun | A is B
い-engine | adjective | A is B

Now, let's look at an example sentence.

- 美味しい。  
*Is delicious.*

Now let's say we want to describe a "cake" by saying "Delicious cake" (not to be confused with "cake is delicious"). We would say:

- 美味しいケーキ。  
*Delicious cake* (Lit: Cake that is delicious)

What if I want to say "cake that was bought at a bakery", we would say:

- パン屋さんで買ったケーキ。  
*Cake that was bought at a bakery*

In both sentences, 「美味しい」 and 「パン屋さんで買った」 are describing 「ケーキ」. And we can see that in Japanese, in both cases, that description is said *before* 「ケーキ」. However, in English the order of this "description" switches back and forth, depending on how long or complex the description is. In the first example, "*delicious*" was short and simple, so it is correct to say "*Delicious cake*". But in the second sentence, "*bought at a bakery*" is too long, and saying "*Bought at a bakery cake*" would be incorrect. We would have to say the description *after* "cake": "*Cake that was bought at a bakery*".

Let's look at another example where the "description" is long:

- 友達が先週本屋さんで買った本  
*Book that my friend bought at a book store last week*

The entire description is still said *before* 「本」 in Japanese. This is how Japanese works. Now let's go back to our question "*what is a clause?*" If we look at the "description" part, that sentence in itself is already a complete sentence.

main wagon "A" | に | で | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
友達が | 先週 | 本屋さんで | 買った

That entire sentence -or more precisely, *clause*- is describing the word that follows it: 「本」. So if we include the 「本」 into the train, it would look like this:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="4" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">Clause</th>
    <th rowspan="2" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">main wagon "A"</th>
    <th rowspan="2" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">main wagon "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">に</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">で</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">友達が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">先週</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">本屋さんで</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">買った</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">本</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">?</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Right now, the *clause* that describes 「本」 is a complete sentence in itself, but the entire sentence as a whole is not complete. Let's complete the sentence by adding the engine to it:

- 友達が先週本屋さんで買った本が面白い！  
*The book that my friend bought at a book store last week is interesting!*

Clause | main wagon "A" | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---:
友達が先週本屋さんで買った | 本が | 面白い！

or, it can also be visualized as such:

main wagon "A" | engine "B"
:---: | :---:
友達が先週本屋さんで買った本が | 面白い！

because in reality, the "clause" is just describing "A". The clause doesn't have a wagon of its own. Putting this train analogy aside, what's important is that this sentence is just an "A is B" sentence at the core, and we've simply added more details *about* "A". Let's highlight the "description" part, so we can more easily see that this sentence is really just "A is B" at its core.

- **友達が先週本屋さんで買った**本が面白い！  
*The book __that my friend bought at a book store last week__ is interesting!*

If we omit the description, the core of the sentence is really just "The book is interesting!" 「本が面白い！」.

This is the part where learning the 3 engines during the Sentence Structure section was crucial. Since we can describe any noun (in this case, a "book") by using a clause (which is a complete sentence on its own), then we can use any of the 3 engines to describe the noun.

Examples of **う-engines** clauses that describe a noun (I will highlight the clause in bold):

- **歩く**さくら  
*Sakura who walks*

- **友達が飲んだ**ジュース  
*Juice that friend drank*

- **走ってる**私  
*Me who is running* / *A running me*

- **休んでる**先生  
*Teacher who is taking a break* 

Let's look at examples of **い-engines** clauses that describe a noun:

- **美味しい**ケーキ  
*Delicious cake* / *Cake that is delicious*

- **美しい**姫  
*Beautiful princess* / *Princess that is beautiful*

- **赤い**ペン  
*Red pen* / *Pen that is red*

Let's look at examples of **だ-engines** clauses:

- ❌ 親切だ人

That is incorrect. The correct way of saying it is:

- ⭕ **親切な**人  
*Friendly people*

That's right. This is where the so called **"na-adjectives"** come from. The copula 「だ」 gets transformed into 「な」 when it is used to describe a word in this specific manner:

- 人は親切だ  
*People are friendly*

turns into:

- 親切な人  
*Friendly people* / *People that are friendly*

Now, the first sentence 「人は親切だ」 is a complete sentence. It is a sentence of type "A is B". But the second sentence is an incomplete sentence. It is merely saying "Friendly people".

Let's see some more examples of **だ-engines** clauses:

- **好きな**食べ物  
*Likeable food* / *Food that is liked*

- **有名な**人  
*Famous person* / *Person that is famous*

- **静かな**街  
*Quiet street* / *Street that is quiet*

- **便利な**場所  
*Convenient place* / *Place that is convenient*

- **上手な**学生  
*Skillful student* / *Proficient student* / *Student that is skillful*

- **必要な**書類  
*Necessary documents* / *Documents that are needed*

- **真面目な**後輩  
*Serious junior* / *Earnest junior* / *Junior who is serious*

### Sentence order

In a previous section, when we learned about the particle 「は」, we aslo learned that:
> The order of the wagons doesn't really matter as long as the engine "B" is at the end. What matters is that the particles are attached to the correct word.

And this is mostly correct. I can say:

- 花を友達にあげる
- 友達に花をあげる

and they both mean exactly the same thing: "(I) give flowers to friend".

However, the order of the wagons doesn't matter **only if** the wagons stay inside their own clause. Let's look at the following example:

- 昨日泣いてた私が今日泣いている君を慰めている。  
*I, who was crying yesterday, is comforting you, who is crying today.*

In this sentence, we have two clauses that makes up the entire sentence.

Clause 1 | A | Clause 2 | を | B
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
昨日泣いてた | 私が | 今日泣いている | 君を | 慰めている。

Clause 1 is describing 「私」, clause 2 is describing 「君」.
