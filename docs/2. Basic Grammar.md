# Basic Grammar

## Particles

Particles are one or more hiragana characters that attach to the end of a word to define the grammatical function of that word in the sentence. **This is why we represent each "word-particle" pair as one carriage in our train analogy**. Using the correct particles is very important because the meaning of a sentence can completely change just by changing the particles. For example, the sentence "Eat fish."「魚を食べる」can become "The fish eats."「魚が食べる」 simply by changing one particle.

As we learned in a previous section, there are **logical** particles and there are **non-logical** particles. There are also other particles that we're going to call them as **a-logical**. These are neither logical nor non-logical, and we will learn more about this a later section.

As a reminder, the relationship between Topic-Comment Structure (non-logical) and Subject-Object Structure (logical) can be visualized as such:

<table style="border: 1px solid black">
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">Topic</td>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Comment</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Main Carriage</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Engine</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">X</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">A</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">B</td>
  </tr>
</table>

or a simpler visualization would be:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Topic</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">main carriage "A" + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black"> - </td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black"> - </td>
  </tr>
</table>

 This will become more apparent as we look at some examples below. 

The non-logical particles are 「は」 and 「も」. A non-logical particle is one that **does not change the "role" of a word**, it simply presents it as a topic. All particles that are used in the "topic" part are non-logical particles.

The logical particles are 「が」、「を」、「に」、「へ」and「で」. A logical particle is one that can **change the "role" of a word**, and therefore also changing the **meaning of the sentence**. All particles that are used in the "comment" part, i.e. the "Subject-Object Structure" part, are logical particles.

### 「は」

Now that we have a good understanding about logical and non-logical structures, we can enhance this knowledge one step further by introducing the 「は」 particle. We will look at **what it does and what it doesn't do**. 

So, what is 「は」? To follow the analogy of our hypothetical train, **「は」is more like a flag**. Why do we depict it as a flag? Because that's what it does. **It flags something as the topic of the sentence**. It doesn't say anything about it -that's what the logical sentence is there for. 「は」 simply flags the topic. Therefore, the sentence:

**「私は日本人だ」**

literally means "As for me, (I) am Japanese". To visualize this, here's how it looks by using our train analogy:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">私は 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">main carriage "A" + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">engine "B" + だ</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">日本人だ</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The full sentence in Japanese is 「私はØが日本人だ」. The zero pronoun (Ø) means "I" in this context (we learned this in the "Structures" section of this guide). That same sentence in English would be:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">As for me 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">main carriage "A" + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">engine "B" + だ</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">I</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">am Japanese</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Now, you might ask yourself, "Isn't this overcomplicated? Can't we just pretend that 「私は」 is the main carriage -the "A" carriage?". The answer is NO. Although it works in this example sentence, and even in some other sentences, it doesn't work in every case and that's why you shouldn't do it. When you run into sentences where "pretending that 「は」 is the main carriage" doesn't work, now you suddenly can't comprehend the sentence and you get lost.

To illustrate this, let's take a look at the following sentence:  
Note: 「うなぎ」 means "eel".  

*Ordering food at a restaurant*  
「私はうなぎだ」

The joke is that the person has literally said "I am an eel". After all, if 「私は日本人だ」 means "I am Japanese", then 「私はうなぎだ」 must mean "I am an eel", right? That makes perfect sense, except that 「私は日本人だ」 doesn't actually mean "I am Japanese", it means "As for me, I am Japanese". This is why it is important to not assume that the "topic" is the main carriage "A". If we look at the train for 「私は日本人だ」:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">私は 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">main carriage "A" + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">engine "B" + だ</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">日本人だ</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Ø means "I" based on context (we learned this in the "Structures" section of this guide). However, in the case of 「私はうなぎだ」:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">私は 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">main carriage "A" + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">engine "B" + だ</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">うなぎだ</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Ø means "it". "It" is the thing we're talking about -the subject of the conversation-: *what we are eating for dinner*.

Let's look at another example sentence without 「は」 and let's add in the 「を」 carriage.

Note: 「投げる」(なげる) means "throw"  
「ボール」 means "ball"

**「私がボールを投げる」**

main carriage "A" + 「が」 | 「を」 carriage | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---:
私が | ボールを | 投げる

This sentence means "I throw a ball". The core sentence ("A" and "B") is "I throw" -「私が投げる」-. The non-core 「を」 carriage tells us *what I threw*. It was a ball. Let's introduce one more non-core carriage into the train, so we can better see the role of the 「は」 particle as a **non-logical** unit. Let's introduce the 「に」 carriage:

**「私がボールをさくらに投げる」**

main carriage "A" + 「が」 | 「を」 carriage | 「に」 carriage | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
私が | ボールを | さくらに | 投げる

This sentence means "I throw a ball at Sakura" or "I throw a ball to Sakura". All three particles in this sentence -「が」,「を」and「に」tell us what is happening to each word that it's attached to -they are **logical particles**. 

**The order of the carriages doesn't really matter as long as the engine "B" is at the end. What matters is that the particles are attached to the correct word**. It is perfectly valid to say:

**「私がさくらにボールを投げる」**

main carriage "A" + 「が」 | 「に」 carriage | 「を」 carriage | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
私が | さくらに | ボールを | 投げる

and it means exactly the same thing as the previous sentence. **However if I changed the particles that the words are attached to then the meaning of the sentence also changes**, for example:

**「私にボールをさくらが投げる」**

「に」 carriage | 「を」 carriage | main carriage "A" + 「が」 | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
私に | ボールを | さくらが | 投げる

This sentence means "Sakura throws the ball at me" or "Sakura throws the ball to me". If I say:

**「ボールが私にさくらを投げる」**

main carriage "A" + 「が」 | 「に」 carriage | 「を」 carriage | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
ボールが | 私に | さくらを | 投げる

This sentence means "The ball throws Sakura at me". 

Now that we've seen how logical particles can affect the "role" of a word, let's introduce the 「は」 particle into the sentence to see what a **non-logical** particle does to the sentence.

**「私はさくらにボールを投げる」**

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="4" style="text-align: center">私は 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">"A" carriage + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">「に」 carriage</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">「を」 carriage</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">さくらに</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">ボールを</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">投げる</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This means "As for me, I throw the ball at Sakura". Now let's give the 「は」 flag to the "ball".

**「ボールは私がさくらに投げる」**

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="4" style="text-align: center">ボールは 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">"A" carriage + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">「に」 carriage</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">「を」 carriage</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">私が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">さくらに</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø を</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">投げる</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This means "As for the ball, I throw it at Sakura". Notice how the logical meaning of the sentence doesn't change at all. That is because the **「は」 particle is a non-logical one**, as it was explained before. **It is important to note that giving the 「は」 flag to a word can change the nuance of the sentence**, but we will have a deeper look at these nuances in a later section.

---

It is very common for native speakers to drop almost all the words in a sentence or question, to keep it as short as possible. The unspoken part of the sentence is expected to be inferred by the listener based on context.

For example, a person might ask a roommate in English:

**"What should we eat for dinner?"**

But for a Japanese speaker, they can ask the same question by saying:

Note: 「夕飯」 means "dinner"

**「夕飯は？」**

The literal translation is *"As for dinner?"*. Of course, the actual complete sentence (though not said out loud) can be something like:

**「夕飯は何にする？」**

Which can be roughly translated as *"As for dinner, what should we eat?"*.

Let's look at another dialogue:  

Note: 「今夜」（こんや）means "tonight"  
「空いてる」（あいてる）means "free" (as in "available" or "have time")  
「残念」（ざんねん）means "unfortunate"  
「俺」means "I" (masculine tone)

*Suppose that two friends want to go try out a new restaurant that just opened up*  
**沙織：「私は今夜空いてるよ。健次郎さんは？」**  
**健次郎：「残念。俺は忙しいんだ」**

*Literal translation (not quite literal, but I tried my best)*  
**Saori: As for me, (I) am free tonight. As for Kenjiro?**  
**Kenjiro: Unfortunate. As for me, (I) am busy.**

*Natural English*  
**Saori: I am free tonight. What about you?**  
**Kenjiro: That's unfortunate. I'm busy tonight.**

Notice how Saori says 「健次郎さんは？」 which literally means *"As for Kenjiro?"*. When Saori first started her sentence, she said 「私は。。。」 which means *"As for me..."*. This means that the current topic is "I". By using the 「は」 particle again when she asked 「健次郎さんは？」, she has now changed the topic. Changing the topic in this paritcular way with this particular context implies *"What about you (Kenjiro)?"*.

The complete question would be 「健次郎さんは空いてる？」 which means *"As for Kenjiro, are (you) free?"*. You can see that even in English, asking "What about you?" was enough to convey the meaning of the whole question without actually saying it out loud.

Let's look at another dialogue as example:

Note: 「明日」（あした）means "tomorrow"

**沙織：李依さんは明日？**  
**健次郎：ううん、明日じゃない。**

*Literal translation*  
**Saori: As for Rie, tomorrow?**  
**Kenjiro: No, not tomorrow.**

Since we don't have enough context, we don't have enough information to make sense of this conversation. Given a context, as long as the sentence has something to do with Rie and tomorrow, it can mean anything. For instance, they could be talking about when Rie is taking an exam.
