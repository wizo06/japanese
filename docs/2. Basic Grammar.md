# Basic Grammar

## Particles

Particles are one or more hiragana characters that attach to the end of a word to define the grammatical function of that word in the sentence. **This is why we represent each "word-particle" pair in the same carriage in our train analogy**. Using the correct particles is very important because the meaning of a sentence can completely change just by changing the particles. For example, the sentence "Eat fish."「魚を食べる」can become "The fish eats."「魚が食べる」 simply by changing one particle.

As a reminder, the relationship between Topic-Comment and Subject-Object can be visualized as such:

<table style="border: 1px solid black">
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">Topic</td>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Comment</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Main Carriage</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Engine</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">X</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">A</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">B</td>
  </tr>
</table>

or a simpler visualization would be:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Topic</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">main carriage "A" + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black"> - </td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black"> - </td>
  </tr>
</table>

With this visualization/table in mind, let's learn some basic particles.

### 「は」

What is 「は」? **「は」 is the topic particle**. To follow the analogy of our hypothetical train, **「は」is like a flag**. Why do we depict it as a flag? Because that's what it does. **It flags something as the topic of the sentence**. While the kana 「は」 is normally pronounced as /ha/, it is pronounced /wa/ only when it is being used as the topic particle.

Let's look at an example sentence:

**「私は日本人だ」**

literally means "As for me, (I) am Japanese" or "Speaking of me, (I) am Japanese" or "In relation to me, (I) am Japanese". To visualize this, here's how it looks by using our train analogy:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">私は 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">main carriage "A" + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">engine "B" + だ</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">日本人だ</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The full sentence in Japanese is 「私はØが日本人だ」. The zero pronoun (Ø) means "I" in this context (we learned this in the "Sentence Structures" section). We marked 「私」 as the topic of our sentence by attaching the 「は」 particle to it. That same sentence in English would be:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">As for me 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">main carriage "A" + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">engine "B" + だ</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">I</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">am Japanese</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Now, you might ask yourself, "Isn't this overcomplicated? Can't we just pretend that 「私は」 is the main carriage "A" and translate the sentence as simply "I am Japanese?". The answer is **NO**. Although it works in this example sentence, it doesn't work in every case and that's why you shouldn't do it. When you run into sentences where "pretending that 「は」 is the main carriage" doesn't work, now you suddenly can't comprehend the sentence and you get lost.

To illustrate this, let's take a look at the following sentence:  
Note: 「うなぎ」 means "eel".  

*A group of friends are dining at a restaurant, and one person tells the waiter:*  
「私はうなぎだ」

The joke is that the person has literally said "I am an eel". After all, if 「私は日本人だ」 means "I am Japanese", then 「私はうなぎだ」 must mean "I am an eel", right? That makes perfect sense, except that 「私は日本人だ」 doesn't actually mean "I am Japanese", it means "As for me, I am Japanese". This is why it is important to not assume that the "topic" is the main carriage "A". If we look at the train for 「私は日本人だ」:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">私は 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">main carriage "A" + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">engine "B" + だ</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">日本人だ</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Ø means "I" based on context (again, we learned this in the "Sentence Structures" section). However, in the case of 「私はうなぎだ」, the train looks like this:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">私は 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">main carriage "A" + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">engine "B" + だ</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">うなぎだ</td>
  </tr>
</table>

where Ø means "it". What is "it"? "It" is the thing we're talking about -the subject of the conversation-: *what we are eating for dinner*.

To better understand what the topic particle **does** and what it **doesn't do**, let's look at another example sentence without 「は」 and let's add in the 「を」 carriage.

Note: 「投げる」(なげる) means "throw"  
「ボール」 means "ball"

**「私がボールを投げる」**

main carriage "A" + 「が」 | 「を」 carriage | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---:
私が | ボールを | 投げる

This sentence means "I throw a ball". The core sentence ("A" and "B") is "I throw" -「私が投げる」-. The non-core 「を」 carriage tells us *what I threw*. It was a ball. Let's introduce one more carriage into the train: the 「に」 carriage.

**「私がボールをさくらに投げる」**

main carriage "A" + 「が」 | 「を」 carriage | 「に」 carriage | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
私が | ボールを | さくらに | 投げる

This sentence means "I throw a ball at Sakura" or "I throw a ball to Sakura". All three particles in this sentence -「が」,「を」and 「に」 tell us what is happening to each word that it's attached to. 「が」 tells us *who* threw the ball, 「を」 tells us *what* was thrown, 「に」 tells us *to whom* the ball was thrown.

**The order of the carriages doesn't really matter as long as the engine "B" is at the end. What matters is that the particles are attached to the correct word**. It is perfectly valid to say:

**「私がさくらにボールを投げる」**

main carriage "A" + 「が」 | 「に」 carriage | 「を」 carriage | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
私が | さくらに | ボールを | 投げる

and it means exactly the same thing as the previous sentence. **However if I changed the particles that the words are attached to, then the meaning of the sentence also changes**. For example:

**「私にボールをさくらが投げる」**

「に」 carriage | 「を」 carriage | main carriage "A" + 「が」 | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
私に | ボールを | さくらが | 投げる

This sentence means "Sakura throws the ball at me" or "Sakura throws the ball to me". If I say:

**「ボールが私にさくらを投げる」**

main carriage "A" + 「が」 | 「に」 carriage | 「を」 carriage | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
ボールが | 私に | さくらを | 投げる

This sentence means "The ball throws Sakura at me". 

Now that we've seen how those particles can affect the "role" of a word, let's introduce the 「は」 particle into the sentence to see what a topic particle does to the sentence.

**「私はさくらにボールを投げる」**

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="4" style="text-align: center">私は 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">"A" carriage + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">「に」 carriage</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">「を」 carriage</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">さくらに</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">ボールを</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">投げる</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This means "As for me, (I) throw the ball at Sakura". Now let's give the 「は」 flag to the "ball".

**「ボールは私がさくらに投げる」**

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="4" style="text-align: center">ボールは 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">"A" carriage + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">「に」 carriage</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">「を」 carriage</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">私が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">さくらに</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø を</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">投げる</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This means "As for the ball, I throw (it) at Sakura". 

Notice how the logical meaning of the sentence doesn't change at all. That is because the **「は」 particle is a topic particle**. Let us remind ourselves of the relationship between Topic-Comment and Structure-Object.

<table style="border: 1px solid black">
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">Topic</td>
    <th colspan="4" style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Comment</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Main Carriage</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Engine</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">「に」</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">「を」</th>    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">ボールは</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">私が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">さくらに</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Ø を</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">投げる</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The "Topic" simply brings something up as... well, the topic of the conversation. It doesn't tell us anything *about* the topic. That's what the "Comment" is there for. The "Comment" is what tells us logical information. This is why the "Topic" doesn't change the logical meaning of the sentence -the logical meaning of the "Comment"-.

**It is important to note that giving the 「は」 flag to a word can change the nuance of the sentence every so slightly**, but we don't have to worry about it for now. We will have a deeper look at these nuances in a later section.

---

**How do native speakers use 「は」?**  
It is very common for native speakers to drop almost all the words in a sentence or question, to keep it as short as possible. The unspoken part of the sentence is expected to be inferred by the listener based on context.

For example, a person might ask a roommate in English:

**"What should we eat for dinner?"**

But for a Japanese speaker, they can ask the same question by saying:

Note: 「夕飯」 means "dinner"

**「夕飯は？」**

The literal translation is *"As for dinner?"*. Of course, the actual complete sentence (though not said out loud) can be something like:

**「夕飯は何にする？」**

Which can be roughly translated as *"As for dinner, what should we eat?"*.

Let's look at another dialogue:  

Note: 「今夜」（こんや）means "tonight"  
「空いてる」（あいてる）means "free" (as in "available" or "have time")  
「残念」（ざんねん）means "unfortunate"  
「俺」means "I" (masculine tone)

*Suppose that two friends want to go try out a new restaurant that just opened up*  
**アリス：「私は今夜空いてるよ。ボブさんは？」**  
**ボブ：「残念。俺は今夜忙しいんだ」**

*Literal translation (not quite literal, but I tried my best)*  
**Alice: As for me, (I) am free tonight. As for Bob?**  
**Bob: Unfortunate. As for me, (I) am busy tonight.**

*Natural English*  
**Alice: I am free tonight. What about you?**  
**Bob: That's unfortunate. I'm busy tonight.**

Notice how Alice says 「ボブさんは？」 which literally means *"As for Bob?"*. When Alice first started her sentence, she said 「私は。。。」 which means *"As for me..."*. This means that the current topic is "Alice". By using the 「は」 particle again when she asked 「ボブさんは？」, she has now changed the topic. Changing the topic in this paritcular way in this particular context implies *"What about you (Bob)?"*.

The complete question would be 「ボブさんは今夜空いてる？」 which means *"As for Bob, are (you) free tonight?"*. You can see that even in English, asking "What about you?" was enough to convey the meaning of the whole question without actually saying it out loud.

Let's look at another dialogue as example:

Note: 「明日」（あした）means "tomorrow"

**アリス：リエさんは明日？**  
**ボブ：ううん、明日じゃない。**

*Literal translation*  
**Alice: As for Rie, tomorrow?**  
**Bob: No, not tomorrow.**

Since we don't have enough context, we don't have enough information to make sense of this conversation. Given a context, as long as the sentence has something to do with "Rie" and "tomorrow", it can mean anything. For instance, they could be talking about when Rie is taking an exam.

Let's look at another example:

Note: 「試験」（しけん）means "exam"

**アリス： 今⽇は試験だ。**  
**ボブ： ジョンは？**  
**アリス： ジョンは明⽇。**

*Literal translation*  
**Alice: In relation to today, (it) is exam.**  
**Bob: As for John?**  
**Alice: As for John, (it is) tomorrow.**

*Natural English*  
**Alice: Today is the exam.**  
**Bob: What about John?**  
**Alice: John will take it tomorrow.**

This example shows how generic the topic of a sentence can be. A topic can be referring to any action or object from anywhere even including other sentences. For example, in the last sentence 「ジョンは明⽇」, even though the sentence is about when the exam is for John, the word "exam" doesn't appear anywhere in the sentence!

Let's look at another example:

**ボブ： アリスは学⽣？**  
**アリス： うん、学⽣。**

*Literal translation*  
**Bob: As for Alice, are (you) a student?**  
**Alice: Yes, (I) am a student.**

*Natural English*  
**Bob: Are you a student?**  
**Alice: Yeas, I am.**

Here, Bob is marking "Alice" as the topic when he asked 「アリスは学⽣？」. Notice that once the topic is established, Alice does not have to repeat the topic to answer the question about herself. We know that the zero pronoun is "Alice" based on context. The full sentence from Alice is 「うん、私はØが学生だ。」. 

The 「は」 particle has other properties and nuances, but we will look at them in a later section when we compare 「は」 with 「が」.

### 「も」

Another particle that is very similar to the topic particle is the **inclusive topic particle 「も」**. It is essentially the topic particle with the additional meaning of "also". Basically, it can introduce another topic in addition to the current topic. Its usage is best explained by an example.

**Example 1**

ボブ： アリスは学⽣？  
アリス： うん、トム**も**学⽣。

*Literal translation*  
Bob: As for Alice, are (you) a student?  
Alice: Yes. As for Tom **also**, (he) is a student.

*Natural English*  
Bob: Are you a student?  
Alice: Yeah, and Tom is **also** student.

The inclusion of 「も」 must be consistent with the answer. It would not make sense to say, "I am a student, and Tom is also not a student." Instead, use the 「は」 particle to make a break from the inclusion, i.e. change the topic. Let's look at the next example.

**Example 2**

ボブ： アリスは学⽣？  
アリス： うん、でもトムは学⽣じゃない。

*Literal translation*  
Bob: As for Alice, are (you) a student?  
Alice: Yes, but, as for Tom, (he) is not.

*Natural English*  
Bob: Are you a student?  
Alice: Yeah, but Tom is not.

If the inclusion *is* consistent with the answer, then we can use 「も」.

**Example 3**

ボブ：アリスは学⽣？  
アリス：ううん、トム**も**学⽣じゃない。

*Literal trasnlation*  
Bob: As for Alice, are (you) a student?  
Alice: No, as for Tom **also**, (he) is not a student.

*Natural English*  
Bob: Are you a student?  
Alice: No, Tom is **also** not student.

### 「が」

So far, it seems like in Japanese, we tend to explicitly say the topic, and then the main carriage "A" becomes an invisible one. So when should we use the 「が」 particle for the main carriage "A"? Let's say we don't know what the topic is. Let's say I want to ask "Who is the student?". If I use the topic particle 「は」, the question would become 

Note: 「誰」（だれ） means "who"

**「誰は学生？」**

**"As for who, is (it) a student?"**

and that doesn't make any sense because "who" is not an actual person. This is where 「が」 comes into play.

A reminder of our train analogy:

Main carriage | Engine
:---: | :---:
A | B

What we need in this case is an **"identifier"** because I don't know who the student is. We want to *identify* who is the student. So if I ask "Who is the student?", it means that the main carriage "A" is **unknown**, and the engine "B" is "student". To illustrate:

main carriage "A" + が | engine "B"
:---: | :---:
? が | 日本人

So, all we need to do is put 「誰」 in the main carriage. The question now becomes:

**「誰が学生？」**

**Who is student?**

Makes sense right? The 「が」 particle -as explained in previous sections- marks the main carriage "A". It marks the subject. It marks the doer. It tells us *who*/*what* is doing/being "B". But earlier we said that we needed an *identifier*. Does that mean that the 「が」 particle is an identifier? Absolutely. Let's think about it. The 「が」 particle marks the main carriage "A", therefore it tells us *who*/*what* is doing/being "B". It *identifies* "A" for us.

Let's look at an example:

**ボブ：誰が学⽣？**  
**アリス：ジョンが学⽣。**

Bob: Who is the one that is student?  
Alice: John is the one who is student

Bob wants to identify *who* -among all the possible candidates- is a student. Alice responds that John is the one. Notice, Alice could also have answered with the topic particle to indicate that, "Speaking of John", she knows that he is **a** student (maybe not **the** student). You can see the difference in the next two sentences.

1. **誰が学⽣？**  
**Who is the one that is student?**

2. **学⽣は誰？**  
**(The) student is who?**

The first sentence seeks to identify a *specific* person for "student" while the second sentence is simply talking about a student. I often translate the 「は」 particle as "as for; about; speaking of; in relation to" and the 「が」 particle as "the one; the thing" to illustrate the difference.

Let's look at one more example:

1. **私は学⽣。**  
**As for me, (I am) student.**

2. **私が学⽣。**  
**I (am) the one (that is) student.**

The 「は」 and 「が」 particles are actually quite different if you think of it the right way. The 「が」 particle identifies a specific entity as *the* thing while the 「は」 particle is used only to bring up a new topic of conversation. This is why, in longer sentences, it is common to separate the topic with commas to remove ambiguity about which part of the sentence the topic applies to.

### 「は」 vs 「が」

Now that we learned about the grammatical usage of 「は」 and 「が」, it might still be a little bit confusing for some people. Unlike English, which is a very Subject-Object oriented language, Japanese is a very Topic-Comment oriented language. This is why you see 「は」 more often than 「が」 in a normal sentence like "A is B".

Let's explain the difference between 「は」 and 「が」 again, but not from a grammar standpoint, but from a conversation standpoint. *How do native speakers use those particles?*

Let's start by asking ourselves the "If 「は」 and 「が」 are similar, then why are there two different particles with the seemingly same usage?" The answer is: because there are times when we want to say "this is different compared to other things".

For example, grammatically speaking, the following two sentences are correct.

Note: 「これ」＝ this  
「携帯」（けいたい）＝ cellphone

- これ**は**携帯だ。  
- これ**が**携帯だ。

Both sentences are generally translated the same way into English: "This is a cellphone".

But the one that is used more often is 「これは携帯だ」. When you want to say that *something* is different compared to *other things*, you use 「が」. If there is literally only one cellphone in the entire world, saying 「これが携帯だ」 would be incorrect, because there are no other cellphones to compare it with.

**「が」 is really only used when you are making a comparison**. For example, the following two sentences:

- ⭕ 誰**が**学⽣？
- ❌ 誰**は**学⽣？

The question is asking "Who is a student?".

The first question 「誰が学⽣？」 is grammatically correct, while the second question 「誰は学⽣？」 is not. In this example, there are many people who could be a student, and you want to know *who* is a student among them. You are comparing all those people to each other, and then choosing one person and saying "*that* is the student". Comparing in this manner is the only way 「が」 is used. This is why if you use 「が」 in a normal statement like "A is B", **it can sound very bossy**.

For example, normally you say:

Note: 「医学生」（いがくせい）＝ medical student

私**は**医学生だ。

but if you say this instead:

私**が**医学生だ。

you will end up sounding like you're trying to say *"He's not a medical student. She's also not a medical student. Then who is a medical student? That's right. __I am__ a medical student. I'm differrent from the other students"*. You will end up putting too much emphasis on 「私」 and sounding very rude.

This is also why during self-introduction, you should say:

私**は**さくらだ。  
(This still sounds unnatural and disrespectful, but for other reasons that we haven't looked at yet)

However, if you say this during self-introduction:

私**が**さくらだ。

you will end up sounding like "I am *the* Sakura. I am *the* Sakura that everyone knows about. That's *me*".

Another example I would like to bring up is this: let's say you are with a friend who has never seen what a ramen looks like. There are three dishes in front of you two: sushi, curry rice, and ramen. When you point at the ramen to let your friend know that *that* is ramen, you can say:

あれ**が**ラーメン

Using 「が」 in this manner implies "That (sushi) is not ramen. That (curry rice) is also not ramen. *That* (ramen) is ramen". However, usually when you're just explaining what a ramen is, you should use 「は」.

Another example that might not seem as straightforward to understand is this sentence:

私**が**高校生の時サッカーが好きだった

This sentence roughly translates to "I liked playing soccer when I was in highschool". This sentence might look too complicated for someone who just started learning Japanese. But the point I want to make is that 「が」 was used in the sentence, instead of 「は」. But earlier we learned that
> 「が」 is really only used when you are making a comparison.

so who are we comparing 「私」 to? We are comparing "myself" to "myself". More accurately, we are comparing the "present me" from the "past me" or "the highschool me".

Another way to look at the difference between 「は」 and 「が」 is that 「は」 puts the emphasis on the sentence after it, while 「が」 puts the emphasis on the sentence before it. This makes sense if we look at what we learned at the beginning of this section:
> Japanese is a very Topic-Comment oriented language

which is why using 「は」 is the standard, while using 「が」 is only for comparison and/or emphasis.

One last thing that I would like to bring up is that, even native speakers will sometimes (although very rarely) use the incorrect particle. Therefore, it is *very very* common to hear native speakers ommit the particle in conversations, like this:

- 私、さくらだ。
- 私、医学生だ。

### 「を」

The next particle we will learn is the object particle. The 「を」 kana is attached to the end of a word to signify that that word is the direct object of the verb. This kana is essentially never used anywhere else. That is why the katakana equivalent 「ヲ」 is almost never used since particles are always written in hiragana. The 「を」 kana, while technically pronounced as /wo/ essentially sounds like /o/ in real speech. Here are some examples of the direct object particle in action.

Note: 「魚」（さかな） means "fish"  
「ジュース」 means "juice"

1. **⿂を⾷べる。**  
**Eat fish.**

2. **ジュースを飲む。**  
**Drink juice.**

Unlike the direct object in English, places can also be the direct object of motion verbs such as 「歩く」（あるく） and 「⾛る」（はしる）. Since the motion verb is done **to** the location, the concept of direct object is the same in Japanese. However, as you can see by the next examples, it often translates to something different in English due to the slight difference of the concept of direct object.

Note: 「街」（まち） means "street"  
「ぶらぶら」 means "aimlessly"  
「⾼速道路」（こうそくどうろ） means "expressway" or "highway"

1. **街をぶらぶら歩く。**  
**Aimlessly walk through street. (Lit: Aimlessly walk street)**

2. **⾼速道路を⾛る。**  
**Run through expressway. (Lit: Run expressway)**

3. **家を出る。**  
**Leave the house. (Lit: Exit house)**

### 「に」

The 「に」 particle can specify a target of a verb. This is different from the 「を」 particle in which the verb does something **to** the direct object. With the 「に」 particle, the verb does something **toward** the word associated with the 「に」 particle. For example, the target of any motion verb is specified by the 「に」 particle.

Note: 「日本」（にほん） means "Japan"  
「行く」（いく） means "go"  
「家」（いえ） means "home"  
「帰る」（かえる） means "return back" (specifically to home)  
「部屋」（へや） means "room"  
「来る」（くる） means "come"  

1. **ボブは⽇本に⾏く。**  
**Bob goes to Japan.**

2. **家に帰る。**  
**Go back home.**

3. **部屋に来る。**  
**Come to room.**

4. **さくらにボールを投げる。**  
**Throw ball at Sakura. / Throw ball to Sakura.**

The idea of a target in Japanese is very general and is not restricted to motion verbs. For example, **the location of an object** is defined as the target of the verb for existence (ある and いる). **Time** is also a common target. Here are some examples of non-motion verbs and their targets.

Note: 「猫」（ねこ）＝ cat  
「椅子」（いす）＝ chair  
「台所」（だいどころ）＝ kitchen  
「友達」（ともだち）＝ friend  
「会う」（あう）＝ meet  
「医者」（いしゃ）＝ doctor  
「なる」（なる）＝ become  
「来週」（らいしゅう）＝ next week  
「一時」（いちじ）＝ one o'clock  
「昼ご飯」（ひるごはん）＝ lunch  
「食べる」（たべる）＝ eat

1. **猫は部屋にいる。**  
**Cat is in room.**

2. **いすが台所にある。**  
**Chair is in the kitchen.**

3. **友達に会う。**  
**Meet a friend.**

4. **ジムは医者になる。**  
**Jim becomes doctor.**

5. **来週に図書館に⾏った。**  
**Go to library next week.**

6. **一時に昼ご飯を食べる。**  
**Eat lunch at one o'clock.**

*Note: Don't forget to use 「ある」 for inanimate objects and 「いる」 for animate objects. We will learn about these two verbs in a later section "Copula vs Exist"*

While the 「に」 particle is not always required to indicate time, there is a slight difference in meaning between using the target particle and not using anything at all. In the following examples, the target particle makes the date a specific target **emphasizing** that the friend will go to Japan at that time. Without the particle, there is no special emphasis.

Note: 「来年」（らいねん）＝ next year

1. 友達は、来年、⽇本に⾏く。  
Next year, friend go to Japan.

2. 友達は、来年**に**⽇本に⾏く。  
Friend go to Japan next year.

### 「から」 and 「まで」

In the previous section we learned about the target particle 「に」, which always targets "to" rather than "from". If you wanted to say, "come **from**" for example, you would need to use **「から」**, which means "from". If you used **「に」**, it would instead mean "come **to**". 「から」 is also often paired with **「まで」**, which means "**up to**" or "**until**".

Note: 「アメリカ」 means "America"  
「宿題」（しゅくだい） means "homework"

1. **アリスは、アメリカから来る。**  
**Alice comes from America.**

2. **宿題を今⽇から明⽇までする。**  
**Do homework from today to tomorrow. / Do homework from today until tomorrow.**

### 「へ」

The directional particle 「へ」. While 「へ」 is normally pronounced /he/, when it is being used as a particle, it is always pronounced /e/ (え). The primary difference between the 「に」 and 「へ」 particle is that 「に」 goes to a target as the final, intended destination (both physical or abstract). The 「へ」 particle, on the other hand, is used to express the fact that one is setting out towards the direction of the target. As a result, it is only used with directional motion verbs. It also does not guarantee whether the target is the final intended destination, only that one is heading towards that direction. In other words, the 「に」 particle sticks to the destination while the 「へ」 particle is fuzzy about where one is ultimately headed. For example, if
we choose to replace 「に」 with 「へ」 in the examples from the section about 「に」 particle, the nuance changes slightly.

1. ボブは⽇本**へ**⾏く。  
Bob heads **towards** Japan.

2. 家**へ**帰る。  
Go back **toward** house.

3. 部屋**へ**来る。  
Come **towards** room

Note that we cannot use the 「へ」 particle with verbs that have no physical direction. For example, the following is incorrect.

❌ **医者へなる。**  
(Grammatically incorrect version of 「医者になる」.)

This does not mean to say that 「へ」 cannot set out towards an abstract concept. In fact, because of the fuzzy directional meaning of this particle, the 「へ」 particle can also be used to talk about setting out towards certain future goals or expectations.

Note: 「勝ち」（かち）＝ victory  
「向かう」（むかう）＝ to face / to go towards / to head towards

**勝ちへ向かう。**  
**Go towards victory**

### 「で」

The 「で」 particle will allow us to specify the context in which the action is performed. For example, if a person ate a fish, where did he eat it? If a person went to school, by what means did she go? With what will you eat the soup? All of these questions can be answered with the 「で」 particle. Here are some examples.

1. **映画館で⾒た。**  
**Saw at movie theater.**

2. **バスで帰る。**  
**Go home by bus.**

3. **レストランで昼ご飯を⾷べた。**  
**Ate lunch at restaurant.**

It may help to think of 「で」 as meaning "by way of". This way, the same meaning will kind of translate into what the sentence means. The examples will then read: "Saw by way of movie theater", "Go home by way of bus", and "Ate lunch by way of restaurant."

## Copula vs Exist

So far, we learned that "A is B" in Japanese is 「AはBだ」. An example is:

- **その人はさくらだ。**  
**That person is Sakura.**

However, if we want to say "Sakura is at home", or "Sakura is at school", we cannot say:

- ❌ **さくらは家だ。**  
**Sakura is home.** (As in, Sakura is literally a house)
- ❌ **さくらは学校だ。**  
**Sakura is school.** (As in, Sakura is literally a school)

What is going on here? The problem is that, in English, the *copula* and the verb "*to be*" are the *same word*. When you say this in English:

"Sakura is over there"

you're not saying "Sakura is literally *a place*"; you're saying "Sakura *exists* in that place", "Sakura is *being* in that place". Japanese is not the only language that separates the copula and the verb "to be" into different words. Spanish also does it. For example, if you want to say "I **am** Sakura" in Spanish you would say:

"Yo soy Sakura"  

"soy" is the present singular first-person conjugation of the Spanish copula "ser". But if you want to say "I **am** at school" in Spanish, you would say:

"Yo estoy en la escuela"

"estoy" is the present singular first-person conjugation of the Spanish verb "to be" which is "estar".

**So how do we say "to be" in Japanese?**  
We say 「いる」 for animate objects, and 「ある」 for inanimate objects.

**BIG DISCLAIMER HERE**: separating 「いる」 and 「ある」 into animate and inanimate objects, respectively, is not always true. But we can use this as a general rule of thumb.

Animate objects are things that have life: humans, animals, etc.  
Inanimate objects are things that don't.

For example:

- 教室に椅子が**ある**  
*The chairs are in the classroom* / *There are chairs in the classroom*
- 机の上に鉛筆が**ある**  
*The pencil is on the desk* / *There is a pencil on the desk*
- 教室にジョンさんが**いる**  
*John is in the classroom*
- 庭に犬が**いる**  
*The dog is in the garden* / *There is a dog in the garden*
- 猫は部屋に**いる。**
*The cat is in the room.* / *There is a cat in the room*

Now let's look at some examples where the aforementioned rule doesn't apply.

- ❌ チューリップがいる
- ⭕ チューリップがある  
*There is a Tulip*

So, plants can't be used with 「いる」? Then it just seems like the rule should be "things that move" vs "things that don't move", right? Not true either. Let's look at the following sentences:

- ❌ 人形がある
- ⭕ 人形がいる  
*There is a doll*
- ⭕ 電車がある 
- ⭕ 電車がいる  
*There is a train*
- ⭕ タクシーがある
- ⭕ タクシーがいる  
*There is a taxi*
- ⭕ バスがある
- ⭕ バスがいる  
*There is a bus*
- ⭕ トラックがある
- ⭕ トラックがいる  
*There is a truck*
- ? フィギュアがある
- ❌ フィギュアがいる  
*There is a figurine*
- ⭕ 扇風機がある
- ❌ 扇風機がいる  
*There is an electric fan*
- ⭕ シーリングファンがある
- ❌ シーリングファンがいる  
*There is a ceiling fan*

Vehicles (in the broadest sense of the word) such as trains, cars, boats, etc, are generally used with 「いる」 because there are *people* inside those vehicles. Of course, vehicles can be used with 「ある」 as well, but the nuance changes slightly. Generally speaking, it is ok to simply use 「いる」 for humans and animals, and 「ある」 for the rest. If an exception comes up, like the ones you see above, then you just have to memorize or get used to those few exceptions.
