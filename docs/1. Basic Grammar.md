# Basic Grammar

## Introduction
Every Japanese sentence is fundamentally the same. It has the same core. What does it look like? It looks like this:

Main carriage | Engine
:---: | :---:
A | B

Let's picture it as a train. Every Japanese sentence has these two elements: A and B. The main carriage (A) and the engine (B). The engine is what makes the sentence "move", it is what makes it "work". The carriage has to be there because  without the carriage there's nothing for the engine to move. Those two things are the core of every Japanese sentence. If you can understand this, you can understand every sentence, no matter how complicated it becomes. Later on we'll have a lot more carriages. We can say more about A; we can say more about B; we can combine logical sentences together to make complex sentences. But every Japanese sentence conforms to this basic type. So what are A and B? Let's begin by reminding ourselves that in any language, there are only two kinds of sentences. And they are:

Sentence type | Example
:---: | :---:
A does B | "Sakura walks"
A is B | "Sakura is Japanese"

We can put these into past tense, put them into negative, turn them into questions, we can say more about A, we can say more about B; but ultimately, every sentence boils down to one of these: "A is B" or "A does B". Let's look at how we do this in Japanese. 

### 1. A does B
In Japanese, if we want to say "Sakura walks" (A does B), then "A" is "Sakura" (the main carriage) and "B" is "walks" (the thing she does; the engine of the sentence). In Japanese, "Sakura" is 「さくら」, and "walk" is「歩く」(あるく). Lastly, we need one more thing to make the core Japanese sentence: the 「が」 particle. We will have a more in-depth explanation of particles later on. For now, you just need to know that 「が」 is the center of Japanese grammar. After all, 「が」 is what connects "A" and "B". Putting everything together, to say **"Sakura walks"** in Japanese is:

**「さくらが歩く」**

"A" carriage + が | engine "B"
:---: | :---:
さくら  が | 歩く

In the table above, the particle 「が」 is bundled with the "A" carriage. This is because 「が」 is "marking" the "role" of "Sakura" in the context of the sentence. We will see why this is important in the next section.

### 2. A is B

#### 2.1. A is B (describing "A" by using a noun)

Let's take a look at "A is B" sentence: "Sakura is Japanese". "A" will be "Sakura" and "B" will be "Japanese" (as in the nationality). In Japanese (language), "Japanese" (nationality)  is 「日本人」(にほんじん). Once again, we need the 「が」 to link "A" and "B" together. We mentioned before that 「が」 is bundled with the "A" carriage. In the case, "A is B" sentences, we also need to bundle one more "thing" to the engine "B": the copula 「だ」. Putting everything together, to say **"Sakura is Japanese"** (the nationality) in Japanese (the language) is:

**「さくらが日本人だ」**

"A" carriage + が | engine "B" + だ
:---: | :---:
さくらが | 日本人だ

The copula 「だ」 is essentially acting as the "is" in the English sentence "Sakura is a Japanese person". It is a **one-way** equality sign. "Sakura = Japanese person". But it doesn't work the other way around: "Japanese people are Sakura". They're not all Sakura. Sakura is a Japanese person but a Japanese person is not necessarily Sakura.

#### 2.2. A is B (describing "A" by using an adjective)

In Japanese, adjectives end with the kana 「い」. Let's take a look at an easy example: "Pen is red". "A" is "pen", and "B" is "red". In Japanese, "pen" is 「ペン」, and "red" is 「赤い」(あかい). Putting everything together, to say **"Pen is red"** is:

**「ペンが赤い」**

"A" carriage + が | engine "B"
:---: | :---:
ペンが | 赤い

Now, you might notice that we don't have the copula 「だ」 on this sentence. Why is that? Because 「赤い」 doesn't mean "red", it means "is red". The "equal function" per say is built into the adjectives. This "equal function" is the 「い」 part of the adjective.

### Summary
To summarize, there is 3 types of engine "B"s.

Engine name | Used for | Sentence type
:---: | :---: | :---:
う-engine | verb | A does B
だ-engine | noun | A is B
い-engine | adjective | A is B

## Invisible "A" carriage
We learned how every Japanese sentence has the same core. The main carriage "A" (which is bundled with the 「が」 particle) and the engine "B". We can have a lot more complex carriages as sentences become more complex, but they still have the same core. Now we're going to look at some of those extra carriages. The first one we're going to look at is a very mysterious carriage, but it is also a very important one. What does it look like? Well, while every sentence has the same two core elements, "A" and "B", you can't always see both of them. You can always see the engine "B", but sometimes you can't see the main carriage "A". Why not? When you can't see it, it's because of this: it becomes the invisible carriage. While you can't see it, it's still there. Understanding this is the key to understanding Japanese. So, what is the invisible carriage? In English, the closest equivalent is "it". Let's begin by seeing what "it" does in English. Let's take this sentence as example:

**"The ball rolled down the hill. When the ball go to the bottom, the ball hit a sharp stone. The ball was punctured and all the air came out of the ball."**

Would anybody say it like that? Most likely not, because once we have established what we are talking about, we replace it with "it". So we say:

**"The ball rolled down the hill. When it got to the bottom, it hit a sharp stone. It was punctured and all the air came out of it".**

Now, let's suppose a small child tries to say this and says:

**"Ball rolled down hill, got to bottom, hit sharp stone, got punctured, all the air came out".**

Now, is that difficult to understand? No, it's not. Because in fact we don't need to use this "it" marker everytime, over and over again. English grammar demands it but there's no actual communicative need to do it. And Japanese doesn't do it. In place of "it" - which actually means nothing because it can mean anything. "It" in itself doesn't mean anything; you know what "it" is from context. So if a small child came to the kitchen and said "Got really hungry. Came down to eat something", there's nothing confusing or difficult about this. The child meant "I got really hungry. I came down to eat something". In English, skipping the "I" is not a proper sentence, but in Japanese it is. All those English pronouns like "it", "she", "he", "I", "they", in Japanese can be replaced by the invisible carriage, the zero pronoun. But the important thing to remember is that it is still there. Alright, so let's look at this at work in Japanese. I might say:

**「日本人だ」**

and that means "I am Japanese". So the full sentence is:

"A" carriage + が | engine "B" + だ
:---: | :---:
Ø が | 日本人だ

Ø = I

So this looks as if it only has an engine and no main carriage, but the main carriage is simply invisible. And we can say that "I" is the default value of the zero pronoun (Ø), the invisible carriage. However the context can define it as anything. For example if we hear a rustling in the woods and look over in the direction of it and I say:

**「うさぎだ!」**

"A" carriage + が | engine "B" + だ
:---: | :---:
Ø が | うさぎだ!

that means 「Øがうさぎだ!」 - "It is a rabbit!". "It", "that thing we just saw towards the rustling in the trees", *that* is a rabbit. If I say:

**「土曜日だ」**

"A" carriage + が | engine "B" + だ
:---: | :---:
Ø が | 土曜日だ

I'm saying "It is Saturday". What is "it"? "It" is "today". Or it could mean "tomorrow", or any other meaning, depending on the context. All these sentences are full, complete Japanese sentences, with the 「が」 particle marking the subject - the main carriage "A" - and then there's the engine. But in each of these cases, the main carriage is invisible - but it's still there.

This might sound like unecessary emphasis on the fact that the main carriage is still there even though it's invisible, but it will become much more important as sentences become more complex. Without a good understanding of this concept, they're going to start sounding extremely vague and hard to grasp.

## Core carriages vs non-core carriages

We learned in the introduction section that the core of every Japanese sentence is only composed of two parts: the main carriage "A"" and the engine "B". Let's try adding non-core carriages to the train. Let's try adding the 「を」 carriage (we will have a more in-depth look at each particle in a later section). This carriage contains one noun, which is bundled with the 「を」 particle. Let's take an example sentence:

**「私がケーキを食べた」**

"A" carriage + が | を carriage | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---:
私が | ケーキを | 食べた

This means "I ate cake". The core of the sentence is "I ate" ("A" carriage + engine "B"). The 「を」 carriage is just telling us more about the engine, i.e. *what I ate*. Now, the interesting thing is that we may often see this being said like this:

**「ケーキを食べた」**

"A" carriage + が | を carriage | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---:
Ø が | ケーキを | 食べた

As we learned in the previous section, this is another case of the invisible "A" carriage. We can't have have a sentence without the "A" carriage. We can't have an action being done without a doer. If we say 「ケーキを食べた」, what we're really saying is 「Øがケーキを食べた」. The default value for Ø in the invisible carriage is 「私」(わたし) meaning "I". But, if we're talking about "someone else" at that time, then the context changes and Ø might mean that "someone else".

## The 「は」 particle

Now that we have a good understanding of what the "core" train of a Japanese sentence is supposed to look like -main carriage "A" + engine "B"-, we're now ready to look at the 「は」 particle and **find out what it does and what it doesn't do**. The 「は」 particle can never be part of the core sentence; it can never be a core carriage. It can't be a non-core carriage either, because those carriages (like the 「を」 carriage) are part of the logical structure of the sentence. A noun that is marked by the 「は」 particle is never part of the logical structure of the sentence. **「は」 is a non-logical particle**. So if 「は」 is not a core carriage nor a non-core carriage, what kind of a carriage is it? Well, it's not a carriage at all. A noun that is marked by 「は」 -to follow our analogy of train and carriages- is more like a **flag**. Why do we depict it as a flag? Because that's what it does. It flags something as the topic of the sentence. It doesn't say anything about it -that's what the logical sentence is there for. 「は」 simply flags the topic. Therefore, the sentence:

**「私は日本人だ」**

literally means "As for me, I am Japanese". To visualize this, here's how it can look by using our train, carriages, and flag analogy:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">私は 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">"A" carriage + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">engine "B" + だ</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">日本人だ</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In English, it would be:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">As for me 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">"A" carriage + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">engine "B" + だ</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">I</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">am Japanese</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The full sentence in Japanese is 「私はØが日本人だ」. To reiterate, the full sentence in English is "As for me, I am Japanese".

Now, you might ask yourself, "Isn't this overcomplicated? Can't we just pretend that 「私は」 is the main carriage -the "A" carriage?". The answer is NO. Although it works in this example sentence, and even in some other sentences, it doesn't work in every case and that's why you shouldn't do it. When you run into sentences where "pretending that 「は」 is the main carriage" doesn't work, now you suddenly can't comprehend the sentence and you get lost.

To illustrate this, let's take a look at the following joke:  
Note: 「うなぎ」 means "eel".  
「本当」 means "really" (in this context).

*Two friends are dining at a restaurant, and they're discussing what they're going to order*  
Friend A: 私はうなぎだ。  
Friend B: 本当?

The joke is that friend A has literally said "I am an eel". After all, if 「私は日本人だ」 means "I am Japanese", then 「私はうなぎだ」 must mean "I am an eel", right? That makes perfect sense, except that 「私は日本人だ」 doesn't actually mean "I am Japanese", it means "As for me, I am Japanese". If we look at the table again:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">私は 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">"A" carriage + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">engine "B" + だ</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">日本人だ</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Ø means "I". However, in the case of 「私はうなぎだ」:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">私は 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">"A" carriage + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">engine "B" + だ</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">うなぎだ</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Ø means "it". "It" is the thing we're talking about -the subject of the conversation-: *what we are eating for dinner*. This "context-defined subject" of the zero pronoun (Ø) is going to affect all kinds of sentences as we become more advanced in Japanese.

We've already briefly introduced one non-core carriage in the previous section -the 「を」 carriage. Let's introduce one more non-core carriage into the train, so we can better see the role of the 「は」 particle as a **non-logical** unit. 

Let's start with the 「を」 carriage in the train:  
Note: 「投げる」(なげる) means "throw"  
「ボール」 means "ball"

**「私がボールを投げる」**

main carriage "A" + 「が」 | 「を」 carriage | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---:
私が | ボールを | 投げる

This sentence means "I throw a ball". The core sentence ("A" and "B") is "I throw" -「私が投げる」-. The non-core 「を」 carriage tells us *what I threw*. It was a ball. Now, introducing another non-core carriage: the 「に」 carriage:

**「私がボールをさくらに投げる」**

main carriage "A" + 「が」 | 「を」 carriage | 「に」 carriage | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
私が | ボールを | さくらに | 投げる

This sentence means "I throw a ball at Sakura" or "I throw a ball to Sakura". All three particles in this sentence -「が」,「を」and「に」tell us what is happening to each word that it's attached to. **The order of the carriages doesn't really matter as long as the engine "B" is at the end**. What matters is that the particles is attached to the correct word. It is perfectly valid to say:

**「私がさくらにボールを投げる」**

main carriage "A" + 「が」 | 「に」 carriage | 「を」 carriage | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
私が | さくらに | ボールを | 投げる

and it means exactly the same thing as the previous sentence. **However if I changed the particles that the words are attached to then the meaning of the sentence also changes**, for example:

**「私にボールをさくらが投げる」**

「に」 carriage | 「を」 carriage | main carriage "A" + 「が」 | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
私に | ボールを | さくらが | 投げる

This sentence means "Sakura throws the ball at me" or "Sakura throws the ball to me". If I say:

**「ボールが私にさくらを投げる」**

main carriage "A" + 「が」 | 「に」 carriage | 「を」 carriage | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
ボールが | 私に | さくらを | 投げる

This sentence means "The ball throws Sakura at me". Now let's introduce the 「は」 particle into the sentence.

**「私はさくらにボールを投げる」**

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="4" style="text-align: center">私は 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">"A" carriage + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">「に」 carriage</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">「を」 carriage</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">さくらに</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">ボールを</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">投げる</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This means "As for me, I throw the ball at Sakura". Now let's give the 「は」 flag to the "ball".

**「ボールは私がさくらに投げる」**

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="4" style="text-align: center">ボールは 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">"A" carriage + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">「に」 carriage</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">「を」 carriage</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">私が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">さくらに</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø を</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">投げる</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This means "As for the ball, I throw it at Sakura". Notice how the logical meaning of the sentence doesn't change at all. That is because the 「は」 particle is a non-logical one, as it was explained before. **It is important to note that giving the 「は」 flag to either of the carriages can change the nuance of the sentence**, but we will have a deeper look at this in a later section.

## Three types of engine "B"s

As we discussed in the introduction section, there are 3 types of engine "B"s in our train analogy. These are:

Engine name | Used for | Sentence type
:---: | :---: | :---:
う-engine | verb | A does B
だ-engine | noun | A is B
い-engine | adjective | A is B

Let's have a deeper look at each engine.

### 1. Verbs | う-engine

Let's start by looking at verbs in the "dictionary form" or "plain form". Verbs can be divided into two categories: __*ru-verbs*__ (also known as 一段(いちだん)) and __*u-verbs*__ (also known as 五段(ごだん)). All *ru-verbs* end in 「る」, while *u-verbs* can end in any kana with the *u-vowel* 「う」, including 「る」. Therefore, if a verb does **not** end in 「る」then it must be an *u-verb*.

*Side note: Notice that all verbs in the "dictionary form" end with an「う」u-vowel sound. Hence the name of this engine: the う-engine.*

Quick tip: For verbs ending in 「る」, if the vowel sound preceding the 「る」 is an /a/, /u/ or /o/ vowel sound, it will **always** be an *u-verb*. Otherwise, if it is /i/ or /e/, it will be a *ru-verb* **in most cases**. If you're unsure which category a verb falls into, you can verify with most dictionaries.

In other words, *ru-verbs* can look like

- **〜る**

while *u-verbs* can look like

- **〜く**
- **〜す**
- **〜つ**
- **〜ぬ**
- **〜ふ**
- **〜む**
- **〜る**
- **〜ぐ**
- **〜ぶ**
- **〜ぷ**

Example of ru-verbs | Example of u-verbs
:---: | :---:
⾷べる | 分かる
⾒る | 話す
寝る | 聞く
起きる | 泳ぐ
考える | 遊ぶ
教える | 待つ
出る | 買う
いる | ある
着る | 死ぬ

**There are two verbs that are considered as irregular: 「する」and「来る」.** The reason is that these two verbs do not conjugate in quite the same way as the other two categories do.

### 2. Nouns | だ-engine

The 「だ」 copula. It attaches to a noun, to describe the main carriage "A". It is a *one-way* equality sign. Meaning "A" is "B", but "B" is not necessarily "A". In other words, "A" belongs to the set "B".

Note: 沙織（さおり） is a female name.  
声優（せいゆう） means voice actor/actress.

**「沙織が声優だ」**  
*Saori is a voice actress*

In this example, the 「だ」 copula is attached to 「声優」, and it is describing the main carriage "A", which is 「沙織」. "Saori is a voice actress" but not all voice actresses are Saori. This is the one-way equality property of the 「だ」 copula. 

### 3. Adjectives | い-engine

We call this engine the い-engine because all adjectives in Japanese end with the kana 「い」.

**「ペンが赤い」**

"A" carriage + が | engine "B"
:---: | :---:
ペンが | 赤い

*Pen is red*

As we learned in a previous section, we don't need the 「だ」 copula here because the 「い」 part of the adjective already serves the function of "one-way equality". In other words, 「赤い」 doesn't mean "red", it means "is red".

## Particles

Particles are one or more hiragana characters that attach to the end of a word to define the grammatical function of that word in the sentence. Using the correct particles is very important because the meaning of a sentence can completely change just by changing the particles. For example, the sentence "Eat fish." can become "The fish eats." simply by changing one particle.

As we learned in a previous section, there are **logical** particles and there are **non-logical** particles. There are also other particles that we're going to call them as **a-logical**. These are neither logical nor non-logical, and we will learn more about this later on.

The non-logical particles are 「は」 and 「も」. They do not change the meaning of the sentence (hence non-logical), they just simply mark the topic of the sentence.

The logical particles are 「が」、「を」、「に」、「へ」and「で」.

### 「が」

### 「を」

### 「に」and「へ」

### 「で」
