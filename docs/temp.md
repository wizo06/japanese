    **Example 1**

    - ==恐ろしさに== 震える  
    Tremble with ==fear==

    Main wagon "A" | 「に」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==恐ろしさに== | 震える

    The engine is 「震える」(tremble). What's the reason for trembling? Because of fear.

    - ==蚊に== 苦しむ  
    Suffer from ==mosquitoes==

    Main wagon "A" | 「に」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==蚊に== | 苦しむ

    The engine is 「苦しむ」(suffer). What's the reason for suffering? Mosquitoes. Probably mosquito bites.

    - ==勉強に== 疲れた  
    Tired from ==studying==

    Main wagon "A" | 「に」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:

???+ tip "How do native speakers actually use だ-engine?"

    Colloquially, you will most likely hear native speakers have a **dialogue/conversation** without ending their sentences with 「だ」. For example, a dialogue between two close friends can look like:

    Note: 「元気」 means "in good health"

    Person A: 元気？  
    Person B: うん、元気。

    *Nautral Englsh*  
    Person A: Are you OK? / Are you fine? / How are you doing? / How are you?  
    Person B: Yeah, I'm OK. / Yeah, I'm fine. 

    To fit this dialogue into our train analogy, it will look like this:

    **Person A**

    Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---:
    Ø が | 元気?

    **Person B**

    A simple "yes" | Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    うん、 | Ø が | 元気

    The point I want to make here is that *person B* said "Yes, I **am** OK" 「うん、元気。」 in Japanese without actually saying the "**am**" part (without actually saying the copula 「だ」). This is very common in casual **dialogues/conversations**. In fact, it's so common to the point where if you end your sentences in 「だ」 in casual **dialogues/conversations**, you might sound like an anime character (specifically shounen anime).

    Here are two lines from an anime character:

    - 俺はガキではないの ==だ==。
    - 俺の店 ==だ==。

    If this was a real life conversation, it would probably be like this instead:

    - 俺はガキじゃない ==よ== / 俺はガキじゃないん ==だよ==
    - 俺の店 / 俺の店 ==だよ==

    Let's look at another example. This time we will look at a real life conversation between two guys from a reality TV show called "Terrace House":

    - いつ行くの？
    - 俺ね、来週かな。
    - 俺、３日だよ。
    - だよね、早いよね。
    - 俺のほうが早いよ。

    As you can see, they don't end their sentences with 「だ」. This can be rephrased to sound more like anime characters:

    - いつ行くの{++だ++}？
    - 俺は来週{++だ++}。
    - 俺は３日{++だ++}。
    - そうか、貴様、早いの{++だ++}な。
    - 俺のほうが早い{++ぜ++}。

    Hopefully, you can see that it sounds very anime-ish.

    **So when do native speakers say 「だ」?**  
    Like we saw earlier, it's not that they don't say 「だ」, it's just that they dont end their sentences in 「だ」 in a casual **dialogue/conversation**. In a casual conversation, it is a lot more natural to end your sentences with 「よ」、「ね」、「な」、「よね」、「かな」、etc. These are called "sentence ending particles", and we will learn about them in a later section. Regardless of which engine the sentence is using, native speakers like to end it with a "sentence ending particles" during **dialogues/conversations**. And if the sentence happens to be using a だ-engine, then it will be 「だ」＋「。。。」, such as 「だよ」、「だね」、「だよね」、etc. It is also very common for women to omit 「だ」 even if the sentence is using the だ-engine. Example:

    - ヤキモチ妬き ==だよね==　←　Neutral
    - ヤキモチ妬き ==よね==　←　Feminine

    **However**, there are times when native speakers do end their sentences in 「だ」. This typically only occur when it's **NOT** a dialogue/conversation. There are many reasons, and one of them is to make the sentence sound more emphatic. For example, if a guy is confessing his love to a girl, he might shout:

    - 好きだ！

    Other reasons to end a sentence in 「だ」 are:

    - Emphatic self-expression (like the 「好きだ！」 we saw earlier)
    - Sounding the alarm
    - Invading personal space
    - Casual conversation (this is often accompained with sentence ending particles, like we discussed earlier)

    Explaining each reason is beyond the scope of this grammar guide. If you wish to read more about it, you can start [here](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/da-vs-desu-in-real-life/).

    Side note: this doesn't mean that learning Japanese from watching anime is a bad idea. In fact I strongly encourage it (assuming you like watching anime in the first place). To learn more about why I encourage this, watch [this video by Matt](https://youtu.be/V9ND6uw6-QA).

???+ info

    **How do native speakers use 「は」 in conversations?**  
    It is very common for native speakers to drop almost all the words in a sentence or question, to keep it as short as possible. The unspoken part of the sentence is expected to be inferred by the listener based on context.

    For example, a person might ask a roommate in English:

    - "What should we eat for dinner?"

    But for a Japanese speaker, they can ask the same question by saying:

    Note: 「夕飯」 means "dinner"

    - 「夕飯は？」

    The literal translation is *"As for dinner?"*. Of course, the actual complete sentence (though not said out loud) can be something like:

    - 「夕飯は何にする？」

    Which can be roughly translated as *"As for dinner, what should we eat?"*.

    Let's look at another dialogue:  

    Note: 「今夜」（こんや）means "tonight"  
    「空いてる」（あいてる）means "free" (as in "available" or "have time")  
    「残念」（ざんねん）means "unfortunate"  
    「俺」means "I" (masculine tone)

    *Suppose that two friends want to go try out a new restaurant that just opened up*  
    - アリス：「私は今夜空いてるよ。ボブさんは？」
    - ボブ：「残念。俺は今夜忙しいんだ」

    *Literal translation (not quite literal, but I tried my best)*  
    - Alice: As for me, (I) am free tonight. As for Bob?
    - Bob: Unfortunate. As for me, (I) am busy tonight.

    *Normal English*  
    - Alice: I am free tonight. What about you?
    - Bob: That's unfortunate. I'm busy tonight.

    Notice how Alice says 「ボブさんは？」 which literally means *"As for Bob?"*. When Alice first started her sentence, she said 「私は。。。」 which means *"As for me..."*. This means that the current topic is "Alice". By using the 「は」 particle again when she asked 「ボブさんは？」, she has now changed the topic. Changing the topic in this paritcular way in this particular context implies *"What about you (Bob)?"*.

    The complete question would be 「ボブさんは今夜空いてる？」 which means *"As for Bob, are (you) free tonight?"*. You can see that even in English, asking "What about you?" was enough to convey the meaning of the whole question without actually saying it out loud.

    Let's look at another dialogue as example:

    Note: 「明日」（あした）means "tomorrow"

    - アリス：リエさんは明日？
    - ボブ：ううん、明日じゃない。

    *Literal translation*  
    - Alice: As for Rie, tomorrow?  
    - Bob: No, not tomorrow.

    Since we don't have enough context, we don't have enough information to make sense of this conversation. Given a context, as long as the sentence has something to do with "Rie" and "tomorrow", it can mean anything. For instance, they could be talking about when Rie is taking an exam.

    Let's look at another example:

    Note: 「試験」（しけん）means "exam"

    - アリス： 今⽇は試験だ。
    - ボブ： ジョンは？
    - アリス： ジョンは明⽇。

    *Literal translation*  
    - Alice: In relation to today, (it) is exam.
    - Bob: As for John?
    - Alice: As for John, (it is) tomorrow.

    *Normal English*  
    - Alice: Today is the exam.
    - Bob: What about John?
    - Alice: John will take it tomorrow.

    This example shows how generic the topic of a sentence can be. A topic can be referring to any action or object from anywhere even including other sentences. For example, in the last sentence 「ジョンは明⽇」, even though the sentence is about when the exam is for John, the word "exam" doesn't appear anywhere in the sentence!

    Let's look at another example:

    - ボブ： アリスは学⽣？
    - アリス： うん、学⽣。

    *Literal translation*  
    - Bob: As for Alice, are (you) a student?
    - Alice: Yes, (I) am a student.

    *Normal English*  
    - Bob: Are you a student?
    - Alice: Yeas, I am.

    Here, Bob is marking "Alice" as the topic when he asked 「アリスは学⽣？」. Notice that once the topic is established, Alice does not have to repeat the topic to answer the question about herself. We know that the zero pronoun is "Alice" based on context. The full sentence from Alice is 「うん、私はØが学生だ。」. 

???+ info "Function 2: Interchangeable with 「の」"
    You'll most likely not see this function of 「が」 if you're using beginner-friendly content as your input.

    Basically, this function of 「が」 is exactly the same as the 「の」 we learned for describing a noun using another noun. However, this is often only used in "archaic" phrases like:

    - 我が国
    - 我が祖国
    - 藤が丘
    - 霞が関


???+ info "Function 3: Marks the time of time-related verbs"
    **Example 1**

    - ==楽しい時間を== 過ごした  
    Spent ==fun time==

    Main wagon "A" | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==楽しい時間を== | 過ごした

    In normal English, we might say "I had a good time". Here, the engine is the verb 「過ごす」which means "pass (time)" or "spend (time)" in past-tense. 「楽しい時間」 means "fun time". So, what time did you spend your time on? You spent it on "fun time".

    **Example 2**

    - ==混沌の時代を== 生き抜く  
    Live through ==era of chaos==

    Main wagon "A" | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==混沌の時代を== | 生き抜く

    In normal English, we might say "Survive the test of time". The engine is the verb 「生き抜く」 which means "live" with the nuance of "survived hardships". The word "live" in English has many meanings, but the meaning that I'm talking about here is:
    
    > spend one's life in a particular way or under particular circumstances
    
    such as in the sentence "*people are living in fear in the wake of the shootings*".

    So, going back to our example, what kind of time did we live through? An era/age of chaos.

    **Example 3**

    - ==不惑の年を== 越える  
    Go past (one's) ==prime time==

    Main wagon "A" | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==不惑の年を== | 越える

    The engine is the verb 「超える」("go over" or "pass over" or "go past"). So, what kind of time did we go past? We went past (our) prime time.


???+ info "Function 5: Marks the result or outcome of an change"
    **Example 1**

    - 子供が ==小学校の一年生に== なった

    Main wagon "A" | 「に」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    子供が | ==小学校の一年生に== | なった

    The action is 「なった」(became). What did the kid become? What is the "result" of "become"? First grader of elementary school. The kid went from "not a first grader" and turned into "a first grader". The kid changed from "not a first grader" to "a first grader".

    **Example 2**

    - ==お金持ちに== なりたい  
    Want to become ==rich==

    Main wagon "A" | 「に」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==お金持ちに== | なりたい

    The action is 「なりたい」(want to become). What do we want to become? We want to become rich.

    **Example 3**

    - 信号が ==赤に== 変わる  
    Signal changes to ==red==

    Main wagon "A" | 「に」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    信号が | ==赤に== | 変わる

    The action is 「変わる」(change). What does the signal change to? What does the signal turn into? It turns red.

    - ==映画を見に== 行く  
    Go ==see a movie==

    Main wagon "A" | 「に」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:

    The action is 「行く」(go). The intention is 「映画を見る」(see a movie).

    **Example 2**

    - ==魚を釣りに== 行く  
    Go ==fish a fish==

    Main wagon "A" | 「に」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==魚を釣りに== | 行く

    The action is 「行く」(go). The intention is 「魚を釣る」(fish a fish).

    **Example 3**

    - ==ご飯を食べに== 行く  
    Go ==eat food==

    Main wagon "A" | 「に」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==ご飯を食べに== | 行く

    The action is 「行く」(go). The intention is 「ご飯を食べる」(eat food).

    !!! note
        Notice that the action of the intention changes slightly when we attach 「に」 to it.

        - 見る → 見に
        - 釣る → 釣りに
        - 食べる → 食べに

        We will learn more about this grammar in a later section.

???+ info "To express how many/how much in a time frame"
    **Example 3**

    - ==1ヶ月に== ８日の休みがある  
    There are 8 days of vacation ==in 1 month==

    「に」 | Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    ==1ヶ月に== | ８日の休みが | ある  

    The verb is 「ある」(exist). What is there? There are 8 days of vacation. In what basis are there 8 days of vacation? In 1 month. If the basis was different, say, 2 months, then the number of vacation days would also differ. This is why "1 month" is considered as a basis/standard.

    **Example 4**

    - ==一日に== 三回食べる  
    Eat three times ==in one day==

    Main wagon "A" | 「に」 | Counter | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==一日に== | 三回 | 食べる

    The action is 「食べる」(eat). How many times? 3 times. In what basis do we eat 3 times? We eat 3 times in "one day".


???+ info "Function 3: Marks the cause/reason of the action"

    Shiver with ==cold==

    Main wagon "A" | 「で」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø | ==寒さで== | 震える

    The action is 「震える」(shiver). What's the reason for shivering? What's causing you to shiver? It's because you're cold.

    **Example 2**

    - ==熱で== 学校を休む  
    Skip school due to ==fever==
    
    Main wagon "A" | 「で」 | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø | ==熱で== | 学校を | 休む

    The action is 「休む」 which means "to be absent" or "to take a day off". In Japanese, if you're "taking a day off from school", then "school" is the direct object of 「休む」, which is why 「学校」 is marked with 「を」. Now, what's the reason for taking a day off from school? The reason is "fever".

    **Example 3**

    - ==受験準備で== 忙しい  
    Busy due to ==preparations for entrance examination==

    Main wagon "A" | 「で」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:

    Main wagon "A" | 「で」 | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø | ==火事で== | すべてを | 失う

    The aciton is 「失う」 which means "lose". The word "lose" in English has many meanings, but the one I'm talking about here is

    > be deprived of or cease to have or retain (something)

    such as in the sentence "she lost her husband in the fire".

    So, going back to our example, what did we lose? We lost 「すべて」(everything), which is marked by 「を」. Why did we lose everything? What's the reason for our loss? The reason is "conflagration" or "fire".

    The applications will close by ==tomorrow==

    Main wagon "A" | 「で」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    申込みが | ==明日で== | 締め切る

    The action is 「締め切る」 which means "to close off" or "to cut off (because a deadline has expired)", and the deadline is 「明日」(tomorrow).

    店が | ==五時で== | 閉める

    The action is 「閉める」 which means "to close" or "to shut". What is closing up? The 「店」(store) is closing up (marked by 「が」). What is the deadline for today's operation? The store will remain open until "5 o'clock". In other words, it will close at 5 o'clock.

???+ info "Function 7: Marks the boundary of a range"
    The word "**range**" is used very loosely here.

    ???+ info "The "range" refers to quantity"
        **Example 1**

        - ==1人で== 泣いた  
        Cried ==alone==

        Main wagon "A" | 「で」 | Engine "B"
        :---: | :---: | :---:
        Ø が | ==1人で== | 泣いた

        The action is 「泣いた」(cried), and we want to express that it happened within the range of "1 person". An alternative translation could be "cried by myself/yourself/himself/herself". The boundary of this "range/quantity" is "1 person".
       
        **Example 2**

        - ==みんなで== 行く  
        Go ==everyone==
        
        Main wagon "A" | 「で」 | Engine "B"
        :---: | :---: | :---:
        Ø が | ==みんなで== | 行く

        The action is 「行く」(go), and we want to express that the action "go (somewhere)" happens with a certain number of people. This "number of people" is a "quantity". If it's 1 person, then the quantity is "1", if it's 2 people, then the quantity is "2". If it's "everyone", then the quantity is "everyone". The boundary of this "range/quantity" is "everyone".

        !!! warning
            Do not confuse this with 「みんな ==と== 行く」 which is literally "go ==with== everyone". We'll see the particle 「と」 later.

        **Example 3**

        - ==全部で== 百円だ  
        (It) is 100 yen ==for everything==

        Main wagon "A" | 「で」 | Engine "B"
        :---: | :---: | :---:
        Ø が | ==全部で== | 百円だ

        The engine is 「百円だ」(is 100 yen). So, 「Øが百円だ」 literally means "(it) is 100 yen", where "it" is presumably the cost of a purchase. Here, we want to express that "it is 100 yen *for all the items*". The boundary of this "range/quantity" is "everything".

        **Example 4**

        - ==3つで== 百円だ  
        (It) is 100 yen == for 3 items==

        Main wagon "A" | 「で」 | Engine "B"

        Ø が | ==全部で== | 百円だ

        Just like the previous example, it's saying "(it) is 100 yen", but this time the quantity is not "everything", it's just "3 items".

        **Example 5**

        - ==それだけで== いい  
        (It) is good ==with only that==

        Main wagon "A" | 「で」 | Engine "B"
        :---: | :---: | :---:
        Ø が | ==それだけで== | いい
        
        In normal English we might say, "That's all I need". The engine is 「いい」(is good). Depending on the context, it can be interpreted as the English word "enough". So we're basically saying "(it) is enough". On top of that, we want to express "(it) is enough *with that amount only*". The boundary of this "range/quantity" is "only that amount".

    ???+ info "The "range" refers to physical place"
        **Example 1**

        - 富士山が ==世界で== 一番綺麗だ    
        Mt. Fuji is the most beautiful mountain ==in the world==.

        Main wagon "A" | 「で」 | Engine "B"
        :---: | :---: | :---:
        富士山が | ==世界で== | 一番綺麗だ  

        「一番」 just means "first" and 「綺麗」 just means "beautiful". So 「一番綺麗」 means "most beautiful.

        Since we have the だ-engine here, we know that it's an "A is B" sentence. In other words, it is 「AがBだ」. What is "A"? It's 「富士山」(Mt. Fuji). What is "B"? It's 「一番綺麗だ」(is the most beautiful). So, now we have 「富士山が一番綺麗だ」, which means "Mt. Fuji is the most beautiful".

        Finally, we want to express that the statement "Mt. Fuji is the most beautiful" is true even when we consider all the mountains in the world. In other words, the boundary of this "range" is "worldwide". So we add 「世界で」. Putting everything together, we have 「富士山が世界で一番綺麗だ」.

        **Example 2**

        - このラーメンが ==全国で== 一番美味しい  
        This ramen is the most delicious ==in the country==

        Main wagon "A" | 「で」 | Engine "B"
        :---: | :---: | :---:
        このラーメンが | ==全国で== | 一番美味しい

        Again, this is an "A is B" sentence, where the core is just 「このラーメンが一番美味しい」 which means "This ramen is the most delicious". We want to express that this statement is true nationwide. So we add 「全国で」. The boundary of this "range" is "nationwide".    

    ???+ info "The "range" refers to something abstract"
        **Example 1**

        - ==私の実力で== 無理だ  
        It's impossible with ==my competency==

        Main wagon "A" | 「で」 | Engine "B"
        :---: | :---: | :---:
        Ø が | ==私の実力で== | 無理だ

        The engine is 「無理だ」(is impossible), and we want to express than the "range of competency" has a boundary of "my competency".

        **Example 2**

        - ==若い人の間で== 人気がある  
        Be popular ==among young people==

        「で」 | Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
        :---: | :---: | :---:
        ==若い人の間で== | 人気が | ある。

        The engine is 「ある」(exist) and the main wagon is 「人気」(popularity). In Japanese, when we want to express that "(something) is popular", we say 「somethingは人気がある」(As for something, there is popularity). Anyways I digress. We're essentially saying "be popular", and the boundary of the "range" where you *are* popular is "among young people".

    
???+ info "Function 5: Marks the result or outcome of an action"
    **Example 1**

    - 雪が =雨と== なった
    Snow became ==rain==

    Main wagon "A" | 「と」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    雪が | ==雨と== | なった

    The engine is 「なった」(became), so 「雪がなった」 is saying "Snow became". What did it became? What did it turn into? It became rain.

    **Example 2**

    - ==無罪と== 決定した  
    Decided that it's ==innocent==

    Main wagon "A" | 「と」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==無罪と== | 決定した

    The action is 「決定する」 which means "to decide". The word "decide" in English has many meanings, but the one I'm talking about here is 

    > give a judgment concerning a matter or legal case.

    such as in the sentence "the courts decided in favor of the New York claimants".

    So, the result of this "decision" or "judgement" is 「無罪」(innocent).

???+ info "Funciton 6: Marks the content of speech or thoughts"
    This function can also be thought of as "quotation". The term "quotation" is used very loosely here.

    **Example 1**

    - ==いいと== 思う  
    (I) think ==is good==

    Main wagon "A" | 「と」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==いいと== | 思う

    The engine is 「思う」(think). When you want to express "I think that ..." in Japanese, you can basically treat whatever you are thinking as a phrase that you can quote, and mark that quote with 「と」.

    **Example 2**

    - ==日本語が一番簡単な言語だと== 思う  
    (I) think that ==Japanese is the easiest language==

    Main wagon "A" | 「と」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==日本語が一番簡単な言語だと== | 思う

    The phrase that we are quoting here is 「日本語が一番簡単な言語だと」(Japanese is the easiest language). The quote can be as long as you want.

    **Example 3**

    - さくらが ==痛い！と== 言った  
    Sakura said ==it hurts!==

    Main wagon "A" | 「と」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    さくらが | ==痛い！と== | 言った

    Of course, we can also use 「と」 to quote what somebody has said. This is an "A does B" sentence, where "A" is 「さくら」(Sakura) and "B" is 「言った」(said). What did Sakura say? She said "it hurts!", so we can quote "it hurts!" with 「と」.

    This example can actually be interpreted in another way.

    - ==さくらが痛い！と== 言った  
    (Someone) said ==Sakura hurts!==

    Main wagon "A" | 「と」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==さくらが痛い！と== | 言った

    In this case, the entire phrase 「さくらが痛い！」 is the quote, and we are saying *somebody* (marked by 「が」) said it. Who is this somebody? It could be anyone. It all depends on context. This is true even in English. If I randomly tell you that somebody said "Sakura hurts!" without specifying *who* is that somebody, would you know who it is? No. But if I said it in a context where you and I understand, then you can probably deduce who I'm referring to with the word "somebody".

    !!! tip
        When the quote is long, or when you're quoting something in the middle of a long sentence, it can get confusing where the quote beings and ends. In written English, we can use the quotation mark `'` or `"` to indicate where the quote begins and ends:

        - Sakura went to the supermarket to buy some groceries, but when she arrived, she realized "Oh no! I forgot to bring my wallet!", so she went back home to get her wallet.

        In written Japanese, the quotation mark is `「」` (as you've seen me use all over in this guide).

        - 「いい」と思う
        - 「日本語が一番簡単な言語だ」と思う
        - さくらが「痛い！」と言った
        - 「さくらが痛い！」と言った

        Here's a snippet from a light novel, so you can see how `「」` is used in dialogues.

        ```
        私はポケットからハンカチを取り出しました。
        「これ、あげます。頭に当ててください」
        「えっ・・・でも」
        「それと、私はこれから瓦の修理をしますから、その辺で少し休んでください」
        「いえ、ぼくも手伝います！」
        「その状態で手伝われても邪魔なだけです。休んでいてください」私はきっぱりと言いました。
        「でもーーー」
        「じゃ・ま・です」
        「・・・はい」
        そして捨て猫のようにしゅんとした彼女は屋根のてっぺんで座り、頭にハンカチを当てました。
        元気に見えてもやはり無理していたらしく、座った途端に彼女は倒れこんでしまいました。
        ```

        Another way to avoid the ambiguity in these two sentences:

        - さくらが「痛い！」と言った
        - 「さくらが痛い！」と言った
        
        without having to use `「」` is to put the main wagon "A" *after* the quote, like this:

        - 痛い！とさくらが言った

        This is similar to how sometimes quoting is done in English:

        - "It hurts!" Sakura said.


???+ info "Function 2: Interchangeable with 「が」"

    When 「の」 connects two nouns, and the second noun is being described by a verb, then 「の」 is interchangeable with 「が」.

    Let's look at one example. I've highlighted {++the two nouns in green++}, and ==the verb in yellow==.

    - {++妹++}の ==描いた== {++絵++}  
    *{++Picture++} that my {++little sister++} ==drew==*

    First noun | の | Second noun
    :---: | :---: | :---: 
    {++妹++} | の | ==描いた== {++絵++}

    Here, 「妹」 is the first noun, 「絵」 is the second noun, and they are linked with the 「の」. The verb 「描いた」 is describing the second noun 「絵」. When we have this specific combination of 「noun + の + verb + noun」, this 「の」 is interchangeable with 「が」, like so:

    - {++妹++}が ==描いた== {++絵++}  
    *{++Picture++} that my {++little sister++} ==drew==*

    First noun | が | Second noun 
    :---: | :---: | :---: 
    {++妹++} | が | ==描いた== {++絵++}

    **More in-depth explanation**  
    If we recall what we learned about the Engine "B", 「妹が描いた」 is just an "A does B" sentence.

    Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---:
    妹が | 描いた

    *Little sister drew*

    And if we recall what we learned about describing a noun using a verb, we simply place the description before the noun:

    - ==妹が描いた== {++絵++}  
    *{++Picture++} ==that little sister drew==*

    The entire sentence (highlighted in ==yellow==) is describing the noun (highlighted in {++green++}). In this specific way of describing a noun, the 「の」 is interchangeable with 「が」.

    Let's look at some more examples:

    - 話の好きな{++人++}  
    - 話が好きな{++人++}  
    *{++People++} who like conversations*

    - 音のない{++世界++}  
    - 音がない{++世界++}  
    *{++World++} where there is no sound*

    - 夜のない{++世界++}  
    - 夜がない{++世界++}  
    *{++World++} where there is no night*

    - 私の言ってる{++こと++}  
    - 私が言ってる{++こと++}  
    *{++Things++} that I am saying*

    - 立場の違う{++二人++}
    - 立場が違う{++二人++}  
    *{++Two people++} who are in different situations*

    Using 「の」 is often favored over using 「が」 when it's part of a bigger sentence. Let's look at the following sentence:

    - 立場 ==の== 違う二人{++が++}残酷な世界の中ですごく美しく友情を育む。

    Main wagon "A" | 「で」 | 「を」 |  Engine "B"
    :--: | :---: | :---: | :---:
    立場 ==の== 違う二人{++が++} | 残酷な世界の中で | すごく美しく友情を | 育む

    The entire phrase 「立場の違う二人」 is the subject of the sentence. In other words, the entire phrase 「立場の違う二人」 is marked by 「が」 as the main wagon "A" of the bigger sentence. Although it is technically possible to say the sentence like this:

    - 立場 ==が== 違う二人{++が++}残酷な世界の中ですごく美しく友情を育む。

    it is NOT encouraged to do so. This is because, if you do this, there will be two 「が」 in the entire sentence, and it becomes harder to recognize *what* is the actual subject (main wagon "A") of the bigger sentence at hand.

    If we look at the sentence where it uses 「の」:

    - 立場 ==の== 違う二人{++が++}残酷な世界の中ですごく美しく友情を育む。

    we can clearly spot the core of the sentence. Remember that the core of any sentence is just main wagon "A" + engine "B".

    Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---:
    二人が | 育む

    and 「立場の違う」 is simply a description of 「二人」.

    However, if we look at the sentence where there are two 「が」:

    - 立場 ==が== 違う二人{++が++}残酷な世界の中ですごく美しく友情を育む。

    suddenly, there are two possible candidates as the main wagon "A".

    Possibility 1

    Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---:
    立場が | 育む

    Possibility 2

    Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---:
    二人が | 育む

    Of course, if someone who is fluent in Japanese is reading that sentence, they can quickly figure out what's the actual subject of the entire sentence before they even finish reading the sentence. Nevertheless, it takes one extra step to do so.


???+ info "Function 3: Marks the extent of something"
    This is where it differs from the English word "until" (although there is still a slight connection if you think of it more abstractly).

    This usage of 「まで」 often gets translated as "even..." with a tone of "unexpected".

    **Example 1**

    - ==明日の分まで== 食べた  
    Ate ==even tomorrow's portion==

    Or in normal English "I even ate tomorrow's portion"

    **Example 2**

    - ==それを言うまで== 必要がない  
    There is no need to ==even say that==

    **Example 3**

    Suppose you have 2 friends. One (Sakura) always supports you, but the other one (Hanako) always makes fun of you. One day, you do something so ridiculous that even the Sakura makes fun of you. In this scenario, you can say out loud:

    - さくらまで！？  
    Even Sakura (is making fun of me)!?


## Relative clauses

We learned how to modify/describe a noun by using the engine.

What is a *clause*? To put it in simple terms, a clause is basically a sentence that is inside another sentence. Let's recall our train analogy here.

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
- | -

In this analogy, there are 3 types of engines.

Engine name | Used for | Sentence type
:---: | :---: | :---:
う-engine | verb | A does B
だ-engine | noun | A is B
い-engine | adjective | A is B

Now, let's look at an example sentence.

- 美味しい。  
*Is delicious.*

Now let's say we want to describe a "cake" by saying "Delicious cake" (not to be confused with "cake is delicious"). We would say:

- 美味しいケーキ。  
*Delicious cake* (Lit: Cake that is delicious)

What if I want to say "cake that was bought at a bakery", we would say:

- パン屋さんで買ったケーキ。  
*Cake that was bought at a bakery*

In both sentences, 「美味しい」 and 「パン屋さんで買った」 are describing 「ケーキ」. And we can see that in Japanese, in both cases, that description is said *before* 「ケーキ」. However, in English the order of this "description" switches back and forth, depending on how long or complex the description is. In the first example, "*delicious*" was short and simple, so it is correct to say "*Delicious cake*". But in the second sentence, "*bought at a bakery*" is too long, and saying "*Bought at a bakery cake*" would be incorrect. We would have to say the description *after* "cake": "*Cake that was bought at a bakery*".

Let's look at another example where the "description" is long:

- 友達が先週本屋さんで買った本  
*Book that my friend bought at a book store last week*

The entire description is still said *before* 「本」 in Japanese. This is how Japanese works. Now let's go back to our question "*what is a clause?*" If we look at the "description" part, that sentence in itself is already a complete sentence.

main wagon "A" | に | で | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
友達が | 先週 | 本屋さんで | 買った

That entire sentence -or more precisely, *clause*- is describing the word that follows it: 「本」. So if we include the 「本」 into the train, it would look like this:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="4" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">Clause</th>
    <th rowspan="2" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">main wagon "A"</th>
    <th rowspan="2" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">main wagon "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">に</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">で</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">友達が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">先週</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">本屋さんで</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">買った</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">本</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">?</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Right now, the *clause* that describes 「本」 is a complete sentence in itself, but the entire sentence as a whole is not complete. Let's complete the sentence by adding the engine to it:

- 友達が先週本屋さんで買った本が面白い！  
*The book that my friend bought at a book store last week is interesting!*

Clause | main wagon "A" | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---:
友達が先週本屋さんで買った | 本が | 面白い！

or, it can also be visualized as such:

main wagon "A" | engine "B"
:---: | :---:
友達が先週本屋さんで買った本が | 面白い！

because in reality, the "clause" is just describing "A". The clause doesn't have a wagon of its own. Putting this train analogy aside, what's important is that this sentence is just an "A is B" sentence at the core, and we've simply added more details *about* "A". Let's highlight the "description" part, so we can more easily see that this sentence is really just "A is B" at its core.

- **友達が先週本屋さんで買った**本が面白い！  
*The book __that my friend bought at a book store last week__ is interesting!*

If we omit the description, the core of the sentence is really just "The book is interesting!" 「本が面白い！」.

This is the part where learning the 3 engines during the Sentence Structure section was crucial. Since we can describe any noun (in this case, a "book") by using a clause (which is a complete sentence on its own), then we can use any of the 3 engines to describe the noun.

Examples of **う-engines** clauses that describe a noun (I will highlight the clause in bold):

- **歩く**さくら  
*Sakura who walks*

- **友達が飲んだ**ジュース  
*Juice that friend drank*

- **走ってる**私  
*Me who is running* / *A running me*

- **休んでる**先生  
*Teacher who is taking a break* 

Let's look at examples of **い-engines** clauses that describe a noun:

- **美味しい**ケーキ  
*Delicious cake* / *Cake that is delicious*

- **美しい**姫  
*Beautiful princess* / *Princess that is beautiful*

- **赤い**ペン  
*Red pen* / *Pen that is red*

Let's look at examples of **だ-engines** clauses:

- ❌ 親切だ人

That is incorrect. The correct way of saying it is:

- ⭕ **親切な**人  
*Friendly people*

That's right. This is where the so called **"na-adjectives"** come from. The copula 「だ」 gets transformed into 「な」 when it is used to describe a word in this specific manner:

- 人は親切だ  
*People are friendly*

turns into:

- 親切な人  
*Friendly people* / *People that are friendly*

Now, the first sentence 「人は親切だ」 is a complete sentence. It is a sentence of type "A is B". But the second sentence is an incomplete sentence. It is merely saying "Friendly people".

Let's see some more examples of **だ-engines** clauses:

- **好きな**食べ物  
*Likeable food* / *Food that is liked*

- **有名な**人  
*Famous person* / *Person that is famous*

- **静かな**街  
*Quiet street* / *Street that is quiet*

- **便利な**場所  
*Convenient place* / *Place that is convenient*

- **上手な**学生  
*Skillful student* / *Proficient student* / *Student that is skillful*

- **必要な**書類  
*Necessary documents* / *Documents that are needed*

- **真面目な**後輩  
*Serious junior* / *Earnest junior* / *Junior who is serious*

### Word order

???+ warning

    **The order of the wagons doesn't really matter as long as the engine "B" is at the end. What matters is that the particles are attached to the correct word**. It is perfectly valid to say:

    - **「私がさくらにボールを投げる」**

    main wagon "A" + 「が」 | 「に」 wagon | 「を」 wagon | engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
    私が | さくらに | ボールを | 投げる

    and it means exactly the same thing as the previous sentence. **However if I changed the particles that the words are attached to, then the meaning of the sentence also changes**. For example:

    - **「私にボールをさくらが投げる」**

    「に」 wagon | 「を」 wagon | main wagon "A" + 「が」 | engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
    私に | ボールを | さくらが | 投げる

    This sentence means "Sakura throws the ball at me" or "Sakura throws the ball to me". If I say:

    - **「ボールが私にさくらを投げる」**

    main wagon "A" + 「が」 | 「に」 wagon | 「を」 wagon | engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
    ボールが | 私に | さくらを | 投げる

    This sentence means "The ball throws Sakura at me". 

In a previous section, when we learned about the particle 「は」, we aslo learned that:
> The order of the wagons doesn't really matter as long as the engine "B" is at the end. What matters is that the particles are attached to the correct word.

And this is mostly correct. I can say:

- 花を友達にあげる
- 友達に花をあげる

and they both mean exactly the same thing: "(I) give flowers to friend".

However, the order of the wagons doesn't matter **only if** the wagons stay inside their own clause. Let's look at the following example:

- 昨日泣いてた私が今日泣いている君を慰めている。  
*I, who was crying yesterday, is comforting you, who is crying today.*

In this sentence, we have two clauses that makes up the entire sentence.

Clause 1 | A | Clause 2 | を | B
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
昨日泣いてた | 私が | 今日泣いている | 君を | 慰めている。

Clause 1 is describing 「私」, clause 2 is describing 「君」.
