Before you start learning Japanese grammar from this guide, I would like you to read this page first.

Here is the most important advice for learning languages: **your interest in learning a language will far outweight any learning methodology**. It doesn't matter if a methodology that someone told you is "objectively" more efficient than your current one; if that methodology isn't engaging or fun for you, then it's useless.

With that being said, there are scientific studies about second language acquisition that we can use as foundations for learning languages more efficiently. In this page, I'd like to present to you Dr. Krashen's theory about language acquisition.

First, let's make a distinction between *acquisition* and *learning*.

## Acquisition

[Refold](https://refold.la/) has done a good job at explaining language acquisition, so I'm just going to copy paste their explanation here:

???+ quote

    **Language Acquisition**
    
    The linguist Stephen Krashen argues that there are two ways to develop language ability: acquisition and studying.

    “Acquiring” a language means building an intuitive knowledge of the language. Acquisition is how we all learned our native language (NL). In our NL, most of us don't know grammar rules: we just know what sounds right and what doesn't. When speaking, we don't have to think about grammar or vocabulary. We just think about the meaning we want to convey and the words flow naturally.

    For example, if you’re fluent in English, you’d agree that the phrase *“the big red dog”* sounds more natural than *“the red big dog”*, but you probably aren’t aware of the complicated grammar rule that explains why.

    “Studying” a language, on the other hand, is the act of learning *about* the language. Learning a language solely through studying is known as the “skill-building” approach. Most language learning solutions focus on skill-building rather than acquisition. They teach you vocabulary and grammar as building blocks to construct sentences. Using this method, you can translate your thoughts from your NL into your target language (TL).

    **No amount of skill-building will help you become fluent.**

    This may seem counter-intuitive. After all, this skill-building approach is how you learned every other subject in school. However, language is not like other subjects.

    What sounds “right” or “wrong” in a language often doesn’t have any rhyme or reason. You may be able to translate a phrase, word-for-word, from English to Korean but it probably won’t make sense. Even if it does, it won’t sound natural. Language is highly specific in unpredictable ways. It is impossible to keep every grammar rule and language-specific phrasing in your head while trying to have a conversation.

    Fortunately, your brain has a built-in mechanism for this exact problem. Every single one of us was born with the ability to naturally acquire language. Contrary to popular belief, this ability does not disappear when you become an adult. In fact, by pairing your mature analytical mind with your innate language acquisition ability, you can learn languages *faster* than children.

    **How Do Children Acquire Language?**

    Our brains are pattern recognition machines. This innate ability allows us to predict the future, appreciate music, and yes, learn languages.

    Children learn language through exposure from their parents. Parents interact with their children, and narrate their experiences. *The ball rolled off the table. Are you hot? Here, let's take off your sweater. Do you want the red one or the blue one?*

    Children acquire language because they understand the meaning behind the message. Over months and years of continuously hearing their parents speak to them, their brains decode the patterns, and they learn how to speak.

    **Replicating Acquisition**

    As adults, we don’t have a parent to talk to us 24/7, but we do have access to the whole of the internet. Using widely available media, we can emulate the language acquisition process that children experience.

    **Footnotes**:  
    Stephen Krashen uses the term "learning" to contrast with "acquisition". Because the term learning is overloaded, we use the term "study" here.

Here's a quote from one of Dr. Krashen's presentation about language acquisition:

!!! quote
    "We acquire language in one way and only one way. When we get comprehensible input in a low anxiety environment." - Stephen Krashen

The two important points in this quote are:

- Comprehensible input
- Low anxiety environment

You can learn more about it in Dr. Krashen's [presentation](https://youtu.be/NiTsduRreug).

## Learning

Now we can talk about *learning* a language. Specifically, learning Japanese.

### 1. Writing system

Japanese writing system consists of Kana (Hiragana + Katakana) and Kanji. Refer to [TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/guide/#kana).

### 2. Phonetics

Learn how to pronounce each Kana. **I strongly recommend that you avoid -as much as possible- looking at *Romaji***. *Romaji* is the phonetic representation of a Kana by using English alphabet, and it helps Japanese learners know how to pronounce a Kana. However, the reason why you should avoid *Romaji* is precisely because the phonetics and sounds of Kanas *cannot* be accurately represented by using English alphabet. The most notorious example is 「ら」、「り」、「る」、「れ」、「ろ」, with their corresponding *Romaji* "ra", "ri", "ru", 're", "ro". The actual sound of those 5 aforementioned Kanas are nowhere near the sound of the English "r". You can use [Tae Kim](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/hiragana)'s hiragana section to listen to the pronounciation of each hiragana. The pronunciation is done by a native speaker, so you can be sure that they are as accurate as it can be.

### 3. Pitch accent

[Dogen has a brief video](https://youtu.be/O6AoilGEers) about Japanese pitch-accent.

[This video from "Matt vs Japan"](https://youtu.be/8s56ekQCAnc) illustrates how pitch-accent works in Japanese.

When I say "learn about pitch accent", I don't necessarily mean that you have to memorize all the pitch accent patterns and rules. All you need to do for now during your beginning stage is to be **aware** that pitch accent exists. Once you're aware that it exists, it will be a lot easier to notice them moving forward. You can use these websites to help identify a word's pitch-accent:

- [OJAD](http://www.gavo.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ojad/eng/phrasing/index) to look up the pitch-accent pattern of a word or sentence (it's correct 99.9% of the time).
- [FORVO](https://forvo.com/) to listen to native speakers pronounce a particular word (each sound sample is user-submitted).
- [Youglish](https://youglish.com/japanese) to listen to native speakers pronounce a particular word by searching through YouTube videos.
- You can also look up a word's pitch accent in **monolingual dictionaries**.

### 4. Vocabulary

This guide only teaches grammar. It doesn't teach vocabulary. For more details on how to learn vocabulary, refer to [TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/guide/#vocabulary) and/or [Refold](https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-1/c/vocabulary). My recommendation is to learn vocabularies from the contents that you use as input.

### 5. Grammar

First, let's define what grammar is.  

!!! quote
    "In linguistics, the grammar of a natural language is its set of structural constraints on speakers' or writers' composition of clauses, phrases, and words." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar)

In other words, grammar is a set of rules that attemps to model how a language works. It is important to emphasize that grammar **does not define** how a language works, but it simply **attempts to describe** how it works. Grammar rules are made after-the-fact. On top of that, languages are always evolving. An incorrect grammar today, could very well be a correct one tomorrow.

**Why learn grammar?**

At the beginning when we made the distinction between acquiring and learning (skill-building) a language, we saw that:

> "No amount of skill-building will help you become fluent."

So what's the point of learning a language, such as learning grammar? You can speed up your acquisition by learning. You can speed up your listening and reading comprehension (acquisition) by learning grammar and vocabulary.

**Grammar is a model**

Grammar, like we said earlier, is just something that attempts to describe how a language works. In other words, grammar is a **model** of a language. When you start learning a new language, your brain has no model for that language yet. If you get a lot of input from that language, your brain will start doing pattern recognition, and it will automatically build a model for that language. The more input you get, the more refined the model becomes. However, if you start doing input from day 1 without knowing any grammar, your brain has to essentially build the model from scratch. By learning grammar, you are essentially giving your brain a model to start from. 

**Choosing a grammar guide**

There are tons of Japanese grammar guides out there. You should find the easiest one to understand for you. If you find this one easy to undersand, then by all means use it. I wrote this guide with two things in mind:

1. Avoid using linguistic terms in this guide for those of you who are not familiar with them. (However, it will help you a lot if you at least know some basic linguistic terms like nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc.) 
2. Teach Japanese grammar in a more structured way that makes sense. When I say "structured way", I mean "building blocks". We start from zero, and every new grammar that we learn is built upon previous grammars.

Unlike traditional textbooks, this grammar guide is not meant to teach you how to output. This guide is meant to be used in tandem with INPUT. The goal of this guide is to help you UNDERSTAND what you are reading/listening to.

**How to use this guide**  
Like I said earlier, this grammar guide is meant to be used in tandem with input. I only expect you to read through the guide and **be aware** that such grammar exists. You don't have to bother too much with the small details.

Here's an excerpt from [TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/guide/#grammar) about learning grammar:

!!! quote
    When approaching grammar, it is important to know that the purpose of a grammar guide is not to make you a master at the language, but to give you only a basic understanding of how things work in the language, and then a true understanding of grammar can only be achieved through immersion. Therefore, I recommend you choose a grammar guide, read/watch it **and** do immersion.

Input itself refers to listening and reading to native content in the target language. Mass input can be referred to as immersion.

## Output

Output does NOT improve your input. Output does not improve your listening or reading comprehension. Output does not improve acquisition.

Output is the RESULT of your input. Output is the result of your acquisition.

!!! note
    This does not necessarily mean that outputting is bad. 
    
    Here's a few reasons why it's OK to output, [written by TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/speaking/).

    [Matt vs Japan also has a video](https://youtu.be/-OuMfLtK3tU) explaining why it's OK to output early.

**The "ceiling" of your output**

!!! quote
    "The quality and quantity of your output is a function of the quality and quantity of your input" - Matt vs Japan. [More about it on this video](https://youtu.be/Df24NIPkvVQ).

Your output can only be as good as your input. If you haven't heard (input) how an idea is expressed in Japanese, you won't know how to express (output) it in Japanese. You could technically, by learning grammar and vocabulary, know how to say something in Japanese without hearing it first; BUT the way you say it, the words you choose, they will (99% of the time) all sound unnatural (even if it's grammatically correct). This is especially true for beginners because you haven't had enough exposure to Japanese.

Here's an excerpt from the [Refold webiste](https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-3/b/output-troubleshooting#NL-Conflicts):

!!! quote
    One of the most common output errors is when you express something as a translation from your NL rather than the natural way it should be expressed in your TL.

    ..., each language has a different way of viewing the world. To speak naturally in your TL, you need to adopt the worldview of your TL.

    Most of the time, you have already acquired the necessary language, but just need to change your mindset. The key to getting around this is asking yourself the right question. Instead of asking, “How do I say this?”, ask yourself “What would a native speaker say in this situation?”. This subtle reframing of the question will often produce completely different results from your subconscious.

## Final notes

ACQUISITION (reading and listening) is the heavy lifting. LEARNING (grammar and vocabularies) is not. **Please do not neglect immersion**. No amount of grammar and vocabulary will help you become fluent if you neglect immersion.
