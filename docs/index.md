# Getting started

## Acquiring the language
For a more in-depth explanation of the **methodology** for acquiring a new language, refer to [TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/) and/or [Refold](https://refold.la/). Let me make this clear, these are just general guidelines, not the bible.

The short version is the following: **get as much as input as you can, i.e. immersion**. Input refers to listening and reading. Output refers to speaking and writing. People *acquire* (not to be confused with *learning*) a language through comprehensible input. This means understanding the message, without necessarily understanding how it was said, or what grammar rule was applied, etc. *Learning* a language means memorizing gramamr rules, memorizing vocabulary, etc. Learning a language will not get you to a high level of fluency. Acquiring will. Of course, if you can do both then you will reach high level of fluency even faster.

With that being said, I still highly recomend you go read through [TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/)'s in-depth explanation. It has a lot of insights and nuances that I skipped in my short explanation.

## Learning the language

Now that you have a basic idea of language acquisition, you might ask yourself **"where does grammar come into play then?"**. You can speed up your listening and reading skill by learning grammar, because you will have a better chance at understanding what the message is trying to convey. However, grammar will not necessarily improve your speaking or writing skills. In fact, more likely than not, it will harm you in ways you don't expect, such as building bad habits of saying things in an unnatural way (even if it's grammatically correct). For more details about output, refer to [TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/speaking/#heres-why-it-may-be-a-good-idea-talking-to-natives) and/or [Refold](https://refold.la/roadmap).

### 1. Learning the writing system

Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji. Refer to [TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/guide/#learning-japanese-effectively).

### 2. Learning pitch accent

High and low pitches. Learn about them here: [Dogen's video](https://youtu.be/O6AoilGEers).

On a side note, [here](https://youtu.be/XE5M-MP5ngg) is a fun video where a native speaker (Kaz) nitpicks Dogen's pitch-accent.

When I say "learn pitch accent", I don't necessarily mean that you have to memorize all the pitch accent patterns and rules. All you need to do for now during your beginning stage, is to be **aware** that pitch accent exists. Once you're aware that it exists, it will be a lot easier to notice them moving forward. You can use the [OJAD website](http://www.gavo.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ojad/eng/phrasing/index) to look up a particular pitch-accent pattern of any word or sentence (it doesn't give you the correct pitch-accent pattern all the time, but it works well 99.9% of the time), or use the [FORVO website](https://forvo.com/) to listen to native speakers pronounce a particular word.

### 3. Learning grammar

This is where this guide comes in. I've compiled most of the knowledge I've learned from various sources into this guide. I will include as many example sentences as I can for each grammar point, but I will try to only use sentences that a native speaker would say, so that you can get an idea of **how** native speakers actually use those grammars. That being said, just like in any other language, even native speakers can say things wrongly (grammatically). Of course, this can be intentional, simply because they want to say it in a funnier way, or say it shorter, or making an emphasis, etc. However, I still believe that learning how things are said properly and correctly is important.
