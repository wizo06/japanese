# Getting started

## Acquiring the language
For a more in-depth explanation of the **methodology** for acquiring a new language, refer to [TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/) and/or [Refold](https://refold.la/). Let me make this clear, those are just general guidelines, and you don't have to follow everything to the letter.

The short version of the methodology is the following: **get as much as input as you can, i.e. immersion**. Input refers to listening and reading. Output refers to speaking and writing. People *acquire* (not to be confused with *learning*) a language through *comprehensible input*. Comprehensible input means "understanding the message", without necessarily "understanding every single word in the message", or "the grammar rules that were used in the sentence", etc. *Learning* a language means memorizing grammar rules, memorizing vocabulary, etc. Acquiring a language happens subconsciously. Learning a language happens consciously. Learning a language will *not* get you to a high level of fluency. Acquiring *will*. Of course, if you can do both then you will improve a lot faster.

I still highly recomend you go read through [TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/)'s and/or [Refold](https://refold.la/)'s in-depth explanation about language acquisition. It has a lot of insights and nuances that I skipped in my short explanation.

## Learning the language

Ok then, **why learn grammar if it's not part of *language acquisition*?** Let's first define what *grammar* is.  

> "In linguistics, the grammar of a natural language is its set of structural constraints on speakers' or writers' composition of clauses, phrases, and words." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar)

What does this mean? In short, grammar is a set of *rules that attempt to describe* how a language works. It is important to emphasize that **grammar *does not define a language*, but instead it *attempts to describe* how it works**. I will try my best to avoid using linguistics terms in this guide for those of you who are not very familiar with those terms. That being said, it will be a lot easier to understand this guide if you at least know some basic linguistic words such as (but not limited to):

- Vowel
- Noun
- Verb
- Adjective
- Adverb

Now that we know what grammar is, let's answer the question **why should you learn grammar?** You can speed up your listening and reading *comprehension* (i.e. acquisition) by learning grammar. Of course, you can improve them without learning grammar as well, but the improvement will be slower. 

However, grammar will not necessarily improve your output. In fact, more likely than not, it will harm your output in ways you don't expect (especially during early stages of acquiring a language), such as building bad habits of saying things in an unnatural way (even if it's grammatically correct). For more details about output, refer to [TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/speaking/#heres-why-it-may-be-a-good-idea-talking-to-natives) and/or [Refold](https://refold.la/roadmap).

**Ok, I'm ready to start *learning*. Where do I start from?**  

### 1. Learning the writing system

First, learn the writing system. In Japanese, this is composed of Kana (Hiragana + Katakana) and Kanji. Refer to [TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/guide/#learning-japanese-effectively).

### 2. Learn the sounds

Second, learn the sound for each Kana, i.e. learn how to pronounce each Kana. **I strongly recommend that you avoid -as much as possible- looking at the *Romaji***. *Romaji* is the representation of Kana in English alphabet, and it helps Japanese learners know how to pronounce a Kana. However, the reason why you should avoid *Romaji* is precisely because the phonetics and sounds of Kanas *cannot* be accurately represented by using English alphabet. The most notorious example is 「ら」、「り」、「る」、「れ」、「ろ」, with their corresponding *Romaji* "ra", "ri", "ru", 're", "ro". The actual sound of those 5 aforementioned Kanas are nowhere near the sound of the English "r". You can use [Tae Kim](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/hiragana)'s hiragana section to listen to the pronounciation of each hiragana. The pronunciation is done by a native speaker, so you can be sure that they are as accurate as it can be.

### 3. Learning pitch accent

Third, learn the Japanese pitch-accent. [Dogen](https://youtu.be/O6AoilGEers) has a brief video about Japanese pitch-accent.

On a side note, [here](https://youtu.be/XE5M-MP5ngg) is a fun video where a native speaker (Kaz) nitpicks Dogen's pitch-accent from one of his videos.

When I say "learn pitch accent", I don't necessarily mean that you have to memorize all the pitch accent patterns and rules. All you need to do for now during your beginning stage, is to be **aware** that pitch accent exists. Once you're aware that it exists, it will be a lot easier to notice them moving forward. You can use the [OJAD website](http://www.gavo.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ojad/eng/phrasing/index) to look up a particular pitch-accent pattern of any word or sentence (it doesn't give you the correct pitch-accent pattern all the time, but it works well 99.9% of the time), or use the [FORVO website](https://forvo.com/) to listen to native speakers pronounce a particular word.

### 4. Learning grammar

This is where this guide comes in. I've compiled most of the knowledge I've learned from various sources into this guide. For each grammar point, I will try to give some examples of how native speakers actually use them. That being said, just like in any other language, even native speakers can say things wrongly (grammatically). Of course, this is done intentionally, simply because people tend to say things shorter in everyday conversation, or perhaps they want to make an emphasis of some sort, etc. However, I still believe that learning how things are said properly and correctly is important.

Note: This guide only teaches grammar. It doesn't teach vocabulary. My best advice for learning vocabulary is to learn them through *immersion*. For more details, refer to [TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/guide/#vocabulary) and/or [Refold](https://refold.la/roadmap).
