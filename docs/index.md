# Getting started

## Acquiring the language

!!! info
    For a more in-depth explanation of the **methodology** for acquiring a new language, refer to [TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/) and/or [Refold](https://refold.la/). Those are just general guidelines, and you don't have to follow everything to the letter.

The short version of the methodology is the following: **get as much as input as you can, i.e. immersion**. 

Input refers to:

- listening
- reading

Output refers to:

- speaking
- writing

People *acquire* (not to be confused with *learning*) a language through *comprehensible input*. Comprehensible input means "understanding the message", without necessarily "understanding every single word in the message", or "the grammar rules that were used in the sentence", etc. *Learning* a language means memorizing grammar rules, memorizing vocabulary, etc. Acquiring a language happens subconsciously. Learning a language happens consciously. Learning a language will *not* get you to a high level of fluency. Acquiring *will*. Of course, if you can do both then you will improve a lot faster.

I still highly recomend you go read [TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/)'s and/or [Refold](https://refold.la/)'s in-depth explanation about language acquisition. It has a lot of insights and nuances that I skipped in my short explanation.

## Learning the language

Ok then, **why learn grammar if it's not part of *language acquisition*?** Let's first define what grammar is.  

!!! quote
    "In linguistics, the grammar of a natural language is its set of structural constraints on speakers' or writers' composition of clauses, phrases, and words." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar)

What does this mean? In short, grammar is a set of *rules that attempt to describe* how a language works. It is important to emphasize that **grammar *does not define a language*, but instead it *attempts to describe* how it works**. There are lots of ways to learn Japanese grammar out there, pick whichever one you feel like you can understand the most. 

Now that we know what grammar is, let's answer the question **why should you learn grammar?** You can speed up your listening and reading *comprehension* (i.e. acquisition) skills by learning grammar. Of course, you can improve those skills  without learning grammar as well, but the improvement will be slower. 

However, grammar will not necessarily improve your output. In fact, more likely than not, it will harm your output in ways you don't expect (especially during early stages of acquiring a language), such as building bad habits of saying things in an unnatural way (even if it's grammatically correct). For more details about output, refer to [TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/speaking/#heres-why-it-may-be-a-good-idea-talking-to-natives) and/or [Refold](https://refold.la/roadmap).

**Ok, I'm ready to start *learning*. Where do I start from?**  

### 1. Writing system

First, learn the writing system. In Japanese, this is composed of Kana (Hiragana + Katakana) and Kanji. Refer to [TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/guide/#learning-japanese-effectively).

### 2. Sounds

Second, learn the sound for each Kana, i.e. learn how to pronounce each Kana. **I strongly recommend that you avoid -as much as possible- looking at *Romaji***. *Romaji* is the phonetic representation of a Kana by using English alphabet, and it helps Japanese learners know how to pronounce a Kana. However, the reason why you should avoid *Romaji* is precisely because the phonetics and sounds of Kanas *cannot* be accurately represented by using English alphabet. The most notorious example is 「ら」、「り」、「る」、「れ」、「ろ」, with their corresponding *Romaji* "ra", "ri", "ru", 're", "ro". The actual sound of those 5 aforementioned Kanas are nowhere near the sound of the English "r". You can use [Tae Kim](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/hiragana)'s hiragana section to listen to the pronounciation of each hiragana. The pronunciation is done by a native speaker, so you can be sure that they are as accurate as it can be.

### 3. Pitch accent

Third, learn the Japanese pitch-accent. [Dogen](https://youtu.be/O6AoilGEers) has a brief video about Japanese pitch-accent.

On a side note, [here](https://youtu.be/XE5M-MP5ngg) is a fun video where a native speaker (Kaz) nitpicks Dogen's pitch-accent from one of his videos.

When I say "learn pitch accent", I don't necessarily mean that you have to memorize all the pitch accent patterns and rules. All you need to do for now during your beginning stage, is to be **aware** that pitch accent exists. Once you're aware that it exists, it will be a lot easier to notice them moving forward. You can use these websites to help identify a word's pitch-accent:

- [OJAD](http://www.gavo.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ojad/eng/phrasing/index) to look up a particular pitch-accent pattern of any word or sentence (it's correct 99.9% of the time).
- [FORVO](https://forvo.com/) to listen to native speakers pronounce a particular word (each sound sample is user-submitted).
- [Youglish](https://youglish.com/japanese) to listen to native speakers pronounce a particular word by searching through YouTube videos.

### 4. Grammar

This is where this guide comes in. Earlier, I said this about learning grammar:

So why learn from this guide? I started writing this guide because I felt like the other guides out there were not good enough. Simple as that. If you find this guide useful to you, then by all means use it. If you find other guides more useful and easier to understand, then by all means use the other guide.

With that out of the way, let's talk about this guide specifically. I will try my best to avoid using linguistics terms in this guide for those of you who are not very familiar with those terms. That being said, it will be a lot easier to understand this guide if you at least know some basic linguistic words such as (but not limited to):

- Vowel
- Noun
- Verb
- Adjective
- Adverb

For each grammar point, I will try to give some examples of how native speakers actually use them. That being said, just like in any other language, native speakers tend to say things colloquially. *Colloquial language* simply refers to a style of communication that is used in casual conversations. Phrases and sentences that are said colloquially tend to have a very *loose grammar*. In other words, they don't strictly follow grammar rules to say things properly. However, I still believe that learning how things are said properly and correctly is important.

!!! note
    This guide only teaches grammar. It doesn't teach vocabulary. My best advice for learning vocabulary is to learn them through *immersion*. For more details, refer to [TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/guide/#vocabulary) and/or [Refold](https://refold.la/roadmap).
