# Sentence Structures

## Subject-Object Structure
Every Japanese sentence at its core is composed of two elements:

<table>
  <td style="border: 1px solid black">A</td>
  <td style="border: 1px solid black">B</td>
</table>

Let's imagine the sentence as a train, where "A" is the **main wagon** and "B" is the **engine**, like so:

Main wagon | Engine
:---: | :---:
A | B

The engine "B" tells us **what the sentence is doing**. The main wagon "A" tells us **who is doing it**. We can add more wagons to the train to: 

- describe "A"
- describe "B" 
- combine sentences (clauses) together to make complex sentences
- etc. 

but the **core** of the train will always be "A" and "B". 

Next, let's remind ourselves that, in any language, there are only two types of sentences.

Sentence type | Example sentence
:---: | :---:
A does B | "Sakura walks"
A is B | "Sakura is Japanese"

We can modify these sentences into past tense, modify them into negative, turn them into questions, etc.

### Main wagon "A"

Let's use these two sentences as examples:

- Sakura walks.
- Sakura is Japanese.

If we put those sentences into the train, they will look like this:

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
Sakura | walks
Sakura | is Japanese

However, in Japanese we need to mark "Sakura" as the main wagon "A". This is where we use the particle 「が」. We attach 「が」 at the end of "Sakura" to mark "Sakura" as the main wagon "A", like so:

Main wagon "A" + が| Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
Sakura が | walks
Sakura が | is Japanese

!!! note
    We will learn more about **particles** in a later section.

### Invisible main wagon "A"

We learned that the core of a Japanese sentence is composed of:

Main wagon "A" + が| Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
- | -

However, you can't always see both of them. **You can always see the engine "B", but sometimes you can't see the main wagon "A"**. Why not? Because the main wagon became an invisible wagon. Even though you can't see it, it's still there. What is the invisible wagon? In English, the closest equivalent is the word "*it*". Let's begin by examining what "*it*" does in English. Let's look at the following sentence:

- The ball rolled down the hill. When the ball go to the bottom, the ball hit a sharp stone. The ball was punctured and all the air came out of the ball.

Would any native English speaker say it like that? Most likely not, because once we have established what we are talking about, we replace it with "*it*". So, a more natural way of saying the sentence would be:

- The ball rolled down the hill. When **it** got to the bottom, **it** hit a sharp stone. **It** was punctured and all the air came out of **it**.

Now, let's suppose a small child tries to say the same sentence but ends up saying:

- Ball rolled down hill, got to bottom, hit sharp stone, got punctured, all the air came out.

Is that difficult to understand? No, it's not. Because, in fact, we don't need to use the "*it*" marker everytime, over and over again. Technically speaking, English grammar demands it but there's no actual communicative need to do it. In Japanese grammar, "*it*" is not demanded at all. 

"*It*" by itself means nothing because it can mean anything. You will know what "*it*" is from context. If a small child came to the kitchen and said:

- Got really hungry. Came down to eat something.

there's nothing confusing or difficult about this. The child meant 

- **I** got really hungry. **I** came down to eat something.

In English, skipping the "I" is not a proper sentence, but in Japanese it is. All those English pronouns like "it", "she", "he", "I", "they", can be replaced by the invisible wagon **the zero-pronoun (Ø)** in Japanese. But the important thing to remember is that it is still there even though it's invisible. 

Alright, let's look at how this is done in Japanese. Suppose we want to say:

- I am Japanese.

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
I | am Japanese

To say that sentence in Japanese, it would be:

- 私が日本人だ。

Main wagon "A" + が | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
私が | 日本人だ

However, it is perfectly valid to simply say:

- 日本人だ。

Main wagon "A" + が | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
Øが | 日本人だ

The literal translation of 「日本人だ」 would be "is Japanese". The *full* sentence of 「日本人だ」 would be:

- Øが日本人だ。

and the zero-pronoun can be assumed to be "I" in this context. The zero-pronoun, just like the English word "it", will always change its meaning based on context. For example, if we hear a rustling in the woods and look over in the direction of the rustles, and say:

- うさぎだ!

Main wagon "A" + が | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
Øが | うさぎだ!

*Literal translation*: "is rabbit!"

In normal English, we would say "it is a rabbit!". What is "*it*"? Well, "*it*" in this context means "*that thing we just saw towards the rustling in the trees*". *That* is a rabbit. Another example is, let's say:

- 土曜日だ。

Main wagon "A" + が | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
Ø が | 土曜日だ

*Literal translation*: "is Saturday"

Or in normal English, we would say "it is Saturday". What is "*it*"? "*It*" could mean "today". Or it could mean "tomorrow", or any other word, depending on the context.

All these sentences are complete Japanese sentences, with two parts: 1. the main wagon "A", and 2. the engine "B". In each of these cases, the main wagon is invisible - but it's still there.

This might sound like unecessary emphasis on the fact that the main wagon is still there even though it's invisible. However, the importance of this emphasis will become more apparent as sentences become more complex. Without a good understanding of this concept, complex sentences are going to start sounding extremely vague and hard to understand.

## Topic-Comment Structure

We learned in the previous section about Subject-Object Structure, which consists of two core elements: the main wagon "A" and the engine "B".

Main wagon "A" + が | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
- | -

There's another type of structure: the Topic-Comment Structure, which also consists of two elements:

Topic | Comment
:---: | :---:
X | Y

The important point here is that the "Comment" part is actually the *Subject-Object Structure* we just learned. In other words:

<table style="border: 1px solid black">
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">Topic</td>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Comment</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Main wagon</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Engine</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">X</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">A</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">B</td>
  </tr>
</table>

or a simpler way of visualizing the train is:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Topic</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Main wagon "A" + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black"> - </td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black"> - </td>
  </tr>
</table>

!!! question "Why is it important to make the distinction between the two structures?"
    Understanding the relationship and distinction between these two structures is the key to understanding the difference between the particle 「は」 and the particle 「が」, which a lot of Japanese learners struggle with. Again, we will have a more in-depth look at particles in a later section.
