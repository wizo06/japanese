# Sentence Structures

## Subject-Object Structure
Every Japanese sentence at its core is composed of two elements:

<table>
  <td style="border: 1px solid black">A</td>
  <td style="border: 1px solid black">B</td>
</table>

Let's imagine the sentence as a train, where "A" is the **main wagon** and "B" is the **engine**, like so:

Main wagon | Engine
:---: | :---:
A | B

The engine "B" tells us **what the sentence is doing**. The main wagon "A" tells us **who is doing it**. We can add more wagons to the train to: 

- describe "A"
- describe "B" 
- combine sentences (clauses) together to make complex sentences
- etc. 

but the **core** of the train will always be "A" and "B". 

Next, let's remind ourselves that, in any language, there are only two types of sentences.

Sentence type | Example sentence
:---: | :---:
A does B | "Sakura walks"
A is B | "Sakura is Japanese"

We can modify these sentences into past tense, modify them into negative, turn them into questions, etc.

## Topic-Comment Structure

We learned in the previous section about Subject-Object Structure, which consists of two core elements: the main wagon "A" and the engine "B".

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
- | -

There's another type of structure: the Topic-Comment Structure, which also consists of two elements:

Topic | Comment
:---: | :---:
X | Y

The important point here is that the "Comment" part is actually the *Subject-Object Structure* we just learned. In other words:

<table style="border: 1px solid black">
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">Topic</td>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Comment</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Main wagon</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Engine</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">X</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">A</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">B</td>
  </tr>
</table>

or a simpler way of visualizing the train is:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Topic</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Main wagon "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black"> - </td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black"> - </td>
  </tr>
</table>

!!! question "Why is it important to make the distinction between the two structures?"
    Understanding the relationship and distinction between these two structures is the key to understanding the difference between the particle 「は」 and the particle 「が」, which a lot of Japanese learners struggle with. We will have a more in-depth look at particles in a later section.
