# Structures

## Subject-Object Structure (Logical)
Every Japanese sentence is fundamentally the same. It has the same core. What does it look like? It looks like this:

Main carriage | Engine
:---: | :---:
A | B

Let's picture it as a train. This train has two elements: A and B. **"A" is the main carriage and "B" is the engine**. The engine is what makes the sentence "move", it is what makes it "work". The main carriage has to be there because  without the main carriage there's nothing for the engine to move. **"A" and "B" are the core of every Japanese sentence**. If you can understand this, you can understand every sentence, no matter how complicated it becomes. We can add more **non-core carriages** to: say more about A; say more about B; combine sentences together to make complex sentences. But every Japanese sentence conforms to the core. It will always have "A" and it will always have "B". So what are A and B? Let's begin by reminding ourselves that in any language, there are only two kinds of sentences. And they are:

Sentence type | Example sentence
:---: | :---:
A does B | "Sakura walks"
A is B | "Sakura is Japanese"

We can put these into past tense, put them into negative, turn them into questions, we can say more about A, we can say more about B; but ultimately, every sentence boils down to one of these: "A is B" or "A does B". Let's look at how we do this in Japanese. 

### 1. A does B
In Japanese, if we want to say "Sakura walks" (A does B), then "A" is "Sakura" (the main carriage) and "B" is "walks" (the thing Sakura does; the engine of the sentence). In Japanese, "Sakura" is 「さくら」, and "walk" is「歩く」(あるく). Lastly, we need one more thing to denote that "A" is *the main carriage*: the 「が」 particle. We will have a more in-depth explanation of particles later on. Putting everything together, to say **"Sakura walks"** in Japanese is:

**「さくらが歩く」**

main carriage "A" + が | engine "B"
:---: | :---:
さくら  が | 歩く

In the table above, the particle 「が」 is bundled with the "A" carriage. This is because 「が」 is marking the "role" of "Sakura" as *the main carriage* in the context of the sentence. We will see why this is important in the later sections.

### 2. A is B

#### 2.1. A is B (describing what "A" is by using a noun)

Let's take a look at "A is B" sentence: "Sakura is Japanese". "A" will be "Sakura" and "B" will be "Japanese" (as in the nationality). In Japanese (language), "Japanese" (nationality)  is 「日本人」(にほんじん). Once again, we need the 「が」 particle to denote that "Sakura" is the main carriage "A". Lastly, we also need to "bundle" one more "thing" to the engine "B": the copula 「だ」. Putting everything together, to say **"Sakura is Japanese"** in Japanese is:

**「さくらが日本人だ」**

main carriage "A" + が | engine "B" + だ
:---: | :---:
さくらが | 日本人だ

A **copula** is a word that equates one thing to another. It is a **one-way** equality sign. In other words, the sentence 「さくらが日本人だ」 means "Sakura belongs to the set of Japanese people". Sakura is a Japanese person but a Japanese person is not necessarily Sakura.

#### 2.2. A is B (describing what "A" is by using an adjective)

In Japanese, all adjectives end with the kana 「い」. Let's take a look at an easy example: "Pen is red". "A" is "pen", and "B" is "red". In Japanese, "pen" is 「ペン」, and "red" is 「赤い」(あかい). Putting everything together, to say **"Pen is red"** is:

**「ペンが赤い」**

main carriage "A" + が | engine "B"
:---: | :---:
ペンが | 赤い

Now, you might notice that we don't have the copula 「だ」 on this sentence. Why is that? Because 「赤い」 doesn't mean "red", it means "is red". The copula is built into the adjective, which is the 「い」 part of the adjective. If we say:

❌ **「ペンが赤いだ」**

then it would mean "Pen is red is", which is unacceptable because there can only be one copula per clause.

### Summary
To summarize, there are 3 types of engines.

Engine name | Used for | Sentence type
:---: | :---: | :---:
う-engine | verb | A does B
だ-engine | noun | A is B
い-engine | adjective | A is B

## Three types of engines

As we learned in the introduction section, there are 3 types of engine in our train analogy.

Engine name | Used for | Sentence type
:---: | :---: | :---:
う-engine | verb | A does B
だ-engine | noun | A is B
い-engine | adjective | A is B

Let's have a deeper look at each engine.

### 1. Verbs | う-engine

Let's start by looking at verbs in the "dictionary form" or more accurately "non-past tense" (We will explain "non-past tense" in a later section). Verbs can be divided into two categories: __*ru-verbs*__ (also known as 「一段」(いちだん)) and __*u-verbs*__ (also known as 「五段」(ごだん)). All *ru-verbs* end in 「る」, while *u-verbs* can end in any kana with the *u-vowel* 「う」, including 「る」. Therefore, if a verb does **not** end in 「る」then it must be an *u-verb*.

*Side note: Notice that all verbs in the "dictionary form" end with an「う」u-vowel sound. Hence the name of this engine: the う-engine.*

---
**Quick tip**

For verbs ending in 「る」, if the vowel sound preceding the 「る」 is an /a/, /u/ or /o/ vowel sound, it will **always** be an *u-verb*. Otherwise, if it is /i/ or /e/, it will be a *ru-verb* **in most cases**. If you're unsure which category a verb falls into, you can verify with most dictionaries.

- Example of *u-verb*: 「分かる」. The preceding kana of「る」is「か」, which has an /a/ vowel sound. Therefore it is an *u-verb*.
- Example of *ru-verb*: 「食べる」. The preceding kana of「る」is「べ」, which has an /e/ vowel sound. Therefore it is likely to be a *ru-verb*. It is, in fact, a *ru-verb*.
- Example of *u-verb*: 「知る」（しる）. The preceding kana of「る」is「し」, which has an /i/ vowel sound. Therefore it is likely to be a *ru-verb*. However, it's actually an *u-verb*.
---

Example of verbs:

Example of ru-verbs | Example of u-verbs | Irregular verbs
:---: | :---: | :---:
⾷べる | 分かる | する
⾒る | 話す | 来る
寝る | 聞く
起きる | 泳ぐ
考える | 遊ぶ
教える | 待つ
出る | 買う
いる | ある
着る | 死ぬ

**There are two verbs that are considered as irregular: 「する」and「来る」.** The reason is that these two verbs do not conjugate in quite the same way as the other two categories do. We will learn conjugations in a later section.

### 2. Nouns | だ-engine

A copula is a word that equates one thing to another but it is a one-way equality sign. In other words, "A is B" but "B is not necessarily A"; "A belongs to the set B"; "A is part of the set B". In Japanese, the hiragana 「だ」 is used as copula. It attaches to a noun "B" to describe the main carriage "A", with the meaning "A is B".

Note: 沙織（さおり） is a female name.  
声優（せいゆう） means voice actor/actress.

**「沙織が声優だ」**  

main carriage "A" + が | engine "B" + だ 
:---: | :---:
沙織が | 声優だ

*Saori is a voice actress*

In this example, the 「だ」 copula is attached to 「声優」, and it is describing the main carriage "A", which is 「沙織」. This sentence means "Saori is a voice actress" but not all voice actresses are Saori. "Saori belongs to the *set* of voice actors/actresses" but not all voice actors/actresses are Saori. This is why we call it the one-way equality sign.

Sometimes, the *set* can have only one element. If we say:

**「その人が沙織だ」**  

main carriage "A" + が | engine "B" + だ 
:---: | :---:
その人が | 沙織だ

*That person is Saori*

This means "that person" (main carriage "A") belongs to a *set with one element* called "Saori" (engine "B").

### 3. Adjectives | い-engine

We call this engine the い-engine because all adjectives in Japanese end with the kana 「い」.

**「ペンが赤い」**

main carriage "A" + が | engine "B"
:---: | :---:
ペンが | 赤い

*Pen is red*

As we learned in a previous section, we don't need the 「だ」 copula here because the 「い」 part of the adjective already serves the function of a copula. In other words, 「赤い」 doesn't mean "red", it means "is red". To re-emphasize, if we say:

❌ **「ペンが赤いだ」**

then the sentence would mean "Pen is red is", which is unacceptable because there can only be one copula per clause.

## Invisible "A" carriage in sentences

We learned how every Japanese sentence has the same core. The main carriage "A" (which is denoted by the「が」particle) and the engine "B". While every sentence has the same two core elements, "A" and "B", you can't always see both of them. **You can always see the engine "B", but sometimes you can't see the main carriage "A"**. Why not? Because it became the invisible carriage. Even though you can't see it, it's still there. Understanding this is the key to understanding Japanese. So, what is the invisible carriage? In English, the closest equivalent is "it". Let's begin by seeing what "it" does in English. Let's take this sentence as example:

**"The ball rolled down the hill. When the ball go to the bottom, the ball hit a sharp stone. The ball was punctured and all the air came out of the ball."**

Would anybody say it like that? Most likely not, because once we have established what we are talking about, we replace it with "it". So we say:

**"The ball rolled down the hill. When it got to the bottom, it hit a sharp stone. It was punctured and all the air came out of it".**

Now, let's suppose a small child tries to say the same sentence but ends up saying:

**"Ball rolled down hill, got to bottom, hit sharp stone, got punctured, all the air came out".**

Now, is that difficult to understand? No, it's not. Because, in fact, we don't need to use the "it" marker everytime, over and over again. English grammar demands it but there's no actual communicative need to do it. And Japanese grammar doesn't demand it. "It" by itself means nothing because it can mean anything; you know what "it" is from context. So if a small child came to the kitchen and said "Got really hungry. Came down to eat something", there's nothing confusing or difficult about this. The child meant "**I** got really hungry. **I** came down to eat something". In English, skipping the "I" is not a proper sentence, but in Japanese it is. All those English pronouns like "it", "she", "he", "I", "they", in Japanese can be replaced by the invisible carriage -the zero pronoun (Ø). But the important thing to remember is that it is still there. Alright, so let's look at this at work in Japanese. I might say:

**「日本人だ」**

and that means "I am Japanese". So the full sentence is:

main carriage "A" + が | engine "B" + だ
:---: | :---:
Ø が | 日本人だ

The zero pronoun (Ø) means "I" in this context. 

At first glance, this sentence looks as if it only has an engine and no main carriage, but the main carriage is simply invisible. And we can say that "I" is the default value of the zero pronoun (Ø) -the invisible carriage. However the context can define it as anything. For example if we hear a rustling in the woods and look over in the direction of it and I say:

**「うさぎだ!」**

main carriage "A" + が | engine "B" + だ
:---: | :---:
Ø が | うさぎだ!

that means 「Øがうさぎだ!」 - "It is a rabbit!". "It", "that thing we just saw towards the rustling in the trees", *that* is a rabbit. If I say:

**「土曜日だ」**

main carriage "A" + が | engine "B" + だ
:---: | :---:
Ø が | 土曜日だ

I'm saying "It is Saturday". What is "it"? "It" is "today". Or it could mean "tomorrow", or any other word, depending on the context. All these sentences are complete Japanese sentences, with two parts: 1. the main carriage "A" with the 「が」 particle, and 2. the engine "B". But in each of these cases, the main carriage is invisible - but it's still there.

This might sound like unecessary emphasis on the fact that the main carriage is still there even though it's invisible, but it will become much more important as sentences become more complex. Without a good understanding of this concept, they're going to start sounding extremely vague and hard to understand.

## Core carriages vs non-core carriages

We learned in the introduction section that the **core** of every Japanese sentence is only composed of two parts: the main carriage "A"" and the engine "B". Let's try adding a **non-core** carriage to our hypothetical train: the 「を」 carriage. We will have a more in-depth look at particles in a later section. This 「を」 carriage contains one noun, which is bundled with the 「を」 particle. Let's look at an example sentence:

Note: 「私」（わたし）means "I"  
「ケーキ」means "cake"  
「食べる」means "eat"

**「私がケーキを食べる」**

main carriage "A" + が | を carriage | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---:
私が | ケーキを | 食べる

This means "I eat cake". The core of the sentence is "I eat" ("A" carriage + engine "B"). The 「を」 carriage is just telling us more about the engine, i.e. *what I eat*. Now, the interesting thing is that we may often see this being said like this:

**「ケーキを食べる」**

main carriage "A" + が | を carriage | engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---:
Ø が | ケーキを | 食べる

As we learned in a previous section, this is another case of the invisible "A" carriage. We can't have have a sentence without the "A" carriage. We can't have an action being done without a doer. We can't eat something without an eater. If we say 「ケーキを食べる」, what we're really saying is 「Øがケーキを食べる」. The default value for Ø in the invisible carriage is "I". But, if we're talking about "someone else" at that time, then the context changes and Ø might mean that "someone else". 

**The key takeaway point in this section is that non-core carriages simply add more details *about* the core elements. These details can be things like describing the *where* I ate the cake, etc.**

## Topic-Comment Structure (Non-Logical)

We just learned in previous sections about Subject-Object Structure -we call this **logical structure**-, which consists of:

Main carriage | Engine
:---: | :---:
A | B

There's another type of structure, which we are introducing in this current section, and that is the Topic-Comment Structure -we call this **non-logical structure**-, which consists of:

Topic | Comment
:---: | :---:
X | Y

and the "Comment" part is actually *the logical structure*. In other words:

<table style="border: 1px solid black">
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">Topic</td>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Comment</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Main Carriage</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Engine</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">X</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">A</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">B</td>
  </tr>
</table>

or a simpler visualization of the structure would be:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Topic</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">main carriage "A" + が</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black"> - </td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black"> - </td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Why is it important to make the distinction between the two structures?**  
Because, like we mentioned earlier, the Subject-Object Structure is *logical* and the Topic-Comment Structure is *non-logical*.

**What do I mean by logical?**  
I call the Subject-Object Structure "logical" because *this* is the sentence that tells us about, well, actual information. As we learned in the Subject-Object Structure section, a simple sentence from this structure can be "I am a student". That is a perfectly valid sentence and nothing else needs to be added onto it to make it complete.

The Topic-Comment Structure, on the other hand, doesn't really tell us about anything -hence, I call it *non-logical*. It simply presents us with a topic, and a comment about the topic. This "comment" is the important part, not the topic. After all, if we look at the table above, the "comment" *is* the *Subject-Object Structure* part. For example, if we simply say "As for me..." then it only presents us with "me" as the topic, and nothing else. There is no comment *about* "me". But if I say, "As for me, I am a student", then this is a complete sentence, and the sentence is actually telling us information.
