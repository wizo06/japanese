!!! warning "WORD ORDER MATTERS (OR DOES IT?)"
    Word order matters in Japanese sentences. And it doesn't at the same time. (Huge asterisk here).

    So, what do I mean by word order matters? There are two rules that we must always follow:

    ???+ info "Rule 1: Engine always goes at the END of the sentence"
        Let's say we have a sentence like this:

        - XがYでZを食べる

        Then the "train" will look like this:

        Main wagon "A" | 「で」 | 「を」 | Engine "B"
        :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
        Xが | Yで | Zを | 食べる

        We can change the order of the wagons however we want **as long as the engine "B" is at the end**:

        -| - | - | Engine "B"
        :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
        Xが | Yで | Zを | 食べる
        Xが | Zを | Yで | 食べる
        Yで | Xが | Zを | 食べる
        Yで | Zを | Xが | 食べる
        Zを | Xが | Yで | 食べる
        Zを | Yで | Xが | 食べる

        Notice that we only changed the order of the **wagons**, NOT the **content** itself of each wagon.

    !!! info "Rule 2: If X is modifying/describing Y, then X must always come BEFORE Y"
        We already saw a sneak peek of this in the section about [Description](description.md).

        If we say:

        - ==美味しい== {++ラーメン++}  
        ==Delicious== {++ramen++}

        then 「美味しい」 is describing 「ラーメン」. Therefore, 「美味しい」 must always come BEFORE 「ラーメン」.

        Another example:

        - ==手を伸ばし抱き止めた激しい== {++光++}  
        {++The ==bursting== light++} ==that I reached out for and held so close==

        The thing that we are talking about is 「光」(light). 「激しい」(bursting) is describing the "light". 「手を伸ばし抱き止めた」(I reached out for and held so close) is also describing the "light". 
        
        Notice that in English, some of the description goes before "light" (bursting), and the other description goes after "light" (I reached out for and held so close). However, in Japanese, the entire description must always go BEFORE 「光」.
