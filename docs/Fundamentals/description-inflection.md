# Description and Inflection

## Describing noun

So far, we learned how to express simple sentences like these:

Japanese | English | Sentence type | Engine name
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
さくらが泣く | Sakura cries | A does B (Verbs) | う-engine
さくらが優しい | Sakura is kind | A is B (Adjectives) | い-engine
さくらが親切だ | Sakura is friendly | A is B (Adjectives) | だ-engine
さくらが学生だ | Sakura is a student | A is B (Nouns) | だ-engine

Let's step back a little bit. Instead of making sentences, let's try simply describing a noun, like so:

- Crying Sakura / Sakura who is crying
- Kind Sakura / Sakura who is kind
- Friendly Sakura / Sakura who is friendly
- Sakura who is a student

We can describe a noun using: a verb, an adjective (i-adjective and na-adjective), or another noun. To do this in Japanese, we simply place the word **before** the noun. Let's look at how this is done.

### Using a verb

We know how to say:

- さくらが歩く。  
*Sakura walks.*

But if we want to describe Sakura by saying:

- Sakura who walks

then we place 「歩く」 before 「さくら」, like so:

- 歩くさくら

Examples of verbs (highlighted) describing a noun:

Japanese | English
:---: | :---:
==話す== 先生 | Teacher ==who talks==
==泳ぐ== 友達 | Friend ==who swims==
==食べる== 犬 | Dog ==that eats==

Let's look at some examples in sentences:

**Example 1**:

- ==泣いてる== さくらが悲しい。

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
==泣いてる== さくらが | 悲しい

In this sentence, 「泣いてる」 means "crying", and 「悲しい」 means "is sad". So, the full sentence reads:

- ==Crying== Sakura is sad.

Notice how we are using the verb "cry" to describe the noun "Sakura".

**Example 2**:

- ==運動した== 女の子が休んでる。

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
==運動した== 女の子が | 休んでる

In this sentence, 「運動した」 means "worked out / exercised", 「女の子」 means "girl", and 「休んでる」 means "resting". So, the full sentence reads:

- Girl ==who excersied== is resting.

Notice how we are using the verb "exercise" to describe the noun "Sakura".

**Example 3**:

- ==教科書を食べた== 犬がやんちゃだ。

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
==教科書を食べた== 犬が | やんちゃだ

In this sentence, 「教科書」 means "textbook", 「食べた」 means "ate", 「犬」 means "dog", and 「やんちゃ」 means "mischievous". So, the full sentence reads:

- Dog ==who ate the textbook== is mischievous.

Notice how we are using the verb "eat" to describe the noun "dog".

### Using an adjective

#### na-adjective

We know how to say:

- さくらが親切だ。  
*Sakura is friendly*

But if we want to describe Sakura by saying:

- Friendly Sakura / Sakura who is friendly

then we place 「親切」 before 「さくら」, like so:

- 親切**な**さくら

???+ warning "Pay attention to the kana 「な」"
    When a na-adjective is describing a noun, the copula 「だ」 is dropped and we use the kana 「な」 to connect the two words (hence the name na-adjectives).

    Again, this explanation isn't entirely correct according to how grammar is actually taught in Japan. However, for the sake of simplicity and to make things easy to understand, we will stick with this explanation. There's no need to fuss over the technical side of things.

Examples of na-adjectives (highlighted) describing a noun:

Japanese | English
:---: | :---:
==有名== な英雄 | ==Famous== hero
==綺麗== な花 | ==Beautiful== flowers
==特別== な日 | ==Special== day

Let's look at some examples in sentences:

**Example 1**:

- ==有名== な女優が来る。

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
==有名== な女優が | 来る

In this sentence, 「有名」 means "famous", 「女優」 means "actress", 「来る」 means "come". So, the full sentence reads:

- ==Famous== actress comes. / ==Famous== actress will come.

**Example 2**:

- ==静か== な町が素晴らしい。

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
==静か== な町が | 素晴らしい

In this sentence, 「静か」 means "quiet / peaceful", 「町」 means "town", 「素晴らしい」 means "wonderful". So, the full sentence reads:

- ==Peaceful== town is wonderful.

**Example 3**:

- ==真面目== なトムが医者だ。

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
==真面目== なトムが | 医者だ

In this sentence, 「真面目」 means "serious / honest", 「医者」 means "doctor". So, the full sentence reads:

- ==Honest== Tom is a doctor.

#### i-adjective

We know how to say:

- さくらが優しい。  
*Sakura is kind*

But if we want to describe Sakura by saying:

- Kind Sakura / Sakura who is kind

then we place 「優しい」 before of 「さくら」, like so:

- 優しいさくら

Examples of "i-adjectives" (highlighted) describing a noun:

Japanese | English
:---: | :---:
==青い== 空 | ==Blue== sky
==明るい== 星 | ==Bright== stars
==美味しい== 寿司 | ==Delicious== sushi

Let's look at some examples in sentences:

**Example 1**:

- ==激しい== 運動が危ない。

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
==激しい== 運動が | 危ない

*==Extreme== exercises are dangerous.*

**Example 2**:

- ==優しい== アリスが ==可愛い== 女の子だ。

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
==優しい== アリスが | ==可愛い== 女の子だ

*==Kind== Alice is ==cute== girl.*

**Example 3**:

- ==白い== 馬が走る。

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
==白い== 馬が | 走る

*==White== horse runs.*

### Using a noun

We can **label** (not to be confused with **describe**) a noun with another noun by linking them with the particle 「の」. (_We will learn the difference between *labeling* and *describing* in the next section about no-adjectives_).

Here are a few examples:

1. ==学校== の{++友達++}  
*==School== {++friends++}*

2. ==川== の{++流れ++}  
*{++Flow++} of ==river==*

3. ==ゼルダ== の{++伝説++}  
==Zelda== 's {++legend++} / *The {++legend++} of ==Zelda==*

4. ==３月== の{++ライオン++}  
*{++Lion++} of ==March==*

5. ==さくら== の{++本++}  
*==Sakura== 's {++book++}* / *{++Book++} of ==Sakura==*

6. ==アメリカ== の{++大学++}  
*==American== {++university++}*

7. ==大学== の{++学生++}  
*==University== {++student++}* / *{++Student++} of ==university==*

8. ==アメリカの大学== の{++学生++}  
*==American university== {++student++}* / *{++Student++} of an ==American university==*

The noun highlighted in {++green++} is what we are talking about, and the noun highlighted in ==yellow== is labeling it.

1. We're talking about 「友達」"friends", and the noun 「学校」"school" is labeling "what type of friends?" / "where are those friends from?"

2. We're talking about 「流れ」"flow", and the noun 「川」"river" is labeling "what type of flow?" / "flow of what?"

3. We're talking about 「伝説」"legend", and the noun 「ゼルダ」"Zelda" is labeling "whose legend?"

4. We're talking about 「ライオン」"lion", and the noun 「３月」"March" is labeling "lion from which month?"

5. Same as #3.

6. Same as #1.

7. Same as #1.

8. Same as #1.

We will learn more about the particle 「の」 in a later section.

???+ tip "Trivia"
    The example sentence #4 is the name of a Manga and Anime series. The English name of the series is "March comes in like a lion".

### no-adjectives

Historically, Japanese did not have na-adjectives, and only had i-adjectives and nouns. Overtime, when new words were introduced into the language they were added as **nouns**. These "new words" are primarily of Chinese origin, such as:

- 綺麗
- 元気
- 安全
- 簡単
- 失礼
- 健康
- 病気

but there are also some that are from other origins, such as English, French, etc:

- リアル
- モダン
- スリリング
- アバンギャルド
- シュール
- シック
- ショック
- フレッシュ
- キュート
- カジュアル
- グレー
- ソロ

Some of these "new words" eventually evolved and became na-adjectives. As a result, some of these "new words" are now used as na-adjectives, but some are still used as nouns, and some are even used as both.

Here's a few examples of "new words" that became na-adjectives:

- 簡単 ==な== 問題
- 失礼 ==な== 人
- 健康 ==な== 人
- 元気 ==な== 人
- フレッシュ ==な== ジュース
- カジュアル ==な== 格好

Here's a few examples of "new words" that stayed as nouns (some dictionaries and textbooks call these **no-adjectives**):

- 病気 ==の== 人
- 普通 ==の== 態度
- 永遠 ==の== 関係
- 反対 ==の== 意見
- 三角 ==の== 紙
- 本当 ==の== 気持ち
- グレー ==の== 傘
- ソロ ==の== 演奏

???+ tip "Trivia"
    Within the set of "na-adjectives", there is also a small subset of native Japanese origin. Some examples are:

    - 静か
    - 爽やか
    - 明らか

#### The adjective ←→ noun spectrum

Adjectives and nouns are not black and white. They actually lie on a spectrum. Some words can be used as nouns (no-adjective) and also as adjectives (na-adjective). Of course, the meaning will also change depending on which one is being used. To best illustrate the change in meaning, let's look at some examples:

1. 綺麗な人  
*beautiful person*

2. 綺麗のヒント  
*beauty hints*

In the first sentence, 「綺麗」 is expressing a characteristic, quality, or attribute of 「人」. The word 「綺麗」 is **describing** 「人」. We already learned this back in the "[A is B (Adjectives)](a-and-b.md#a-is-b-adjectives)" section. To briefly quote what was explained in that section:

> The type of words that expresses property or state is called an adjective.

「綺麗」 is in fact acting as an adjective here.

Now, let's look at the second sentence. Here, 「綺麗」 is used with 「の」. We learned in the previous section that we can label a noun with another noun, and we connect them with the particle 「の」. Does that mean that 「綺麗」 is acting as a noun here? Absolutely. 「綺麗」 is not describing 「ヒント」, it is **labeling** it. The *hints* themselves are not beautiful, it is simply telling us what type of hints they are: they are not about finance or dating; they are about beauty. As we learned from the "[だ-engine](#-engine_1)" section, we are not putting "hints" into the set of "finance" or the set of "dating"; we are putting them into the set of "beauty".

Some words are always used with 「な」, while others are always used with 「の」. There are also some words that can be used with both, just like the examples that we saw earlier. Here's a small chart that shows all three categories:

Always 「の」 | Usually 「の」＞「な」 | Usually 「な」＞「の」 | Always 「な」
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
少し | 大量 | 元気 | 簡単
本当 | 病気 | 健康 | 好き
永遠 | 最高 | 安全 | 大切
最大 | 普通 | 美人 | 静か
沢山 | 未定 | 不思議 | 大変
真実 | 独自 | 平和 | 素敵
一杯 | 最速 | 不安 | 勝手

na-adjectives can usually be modified by an adverb of degree, such as: 「すごく」(super), 「とても」(very), 「ちょっと」(a little), 「かなり」(fairly), 「あまり」(not very).

no-adjectives can be loosely divided into two groups:

1. words that expresses absolutes, such as 「本当」(true), 「最大」(the biggest)
2. words that expresses quantities, such as 「沢山」(many), 「大量」(large amount)

Let's look at two examples of no-adjectives that expresses **absolutes**:

- 本当の理由  
*True reason*

- 最大の原因  
*The biggest cause*

The fact that 「本当」 and 「最大」 are acting as nouns here might be hard for English speakers to see, since "true" and "biggest" are adjectives in English. Here's the logic behind it: a noun such as "dog" expresses absolutes. Something either is or isn't a dog. Similarly, something either is or isn't true. Something either is or isn't the biggest. That's not the case with na-adjectives. A na-adjective such as 「静か」(quiet) can be modified by an adverb of degree such as 「ちょっと静か」(a little quiet). However, the lack of grey area for absolutes like 「最大」 means that they can't be modified by an adverb of degree.

Now let's look at two examples of no-adjectives that expresses **quantities**:

- {++すごく++} ==沢山== の魚  
*{++Incredibly++} ==many== fish*

- {++かなり++} ==大量== のデータ  
*{++Fairly++} ==large amount== of data*

In the first example, 「沢山」 labels the noun 「魚」 ー it tells us that this is "a lot of fish" rather than "not a lot of fish". Likewise, in the second example, 「大量」 labels the noun 「データ」 ー it tells us that this is "a large amount of data" rather than "not a large amount of data".

However, quantities are inherently gradable; if we add more fish to 「沢山の魚」, then it would be fair to use an adverb of degree like 「すごく」 to say 「すごく沢山の魚」(incredibly many fish).

Now, let's switch gears and look at two more examples that contrast na-adjectives vs no-adjectives:

**Example 1**:

Person A: 新しい彼氏、有名な人？  
*Is your new boyfriend a famous person?*

Person B: ううん、普通 ==の== 人だよ。  
*No, he's a normal person*

In this example, *person B* chooses to answer the question with 「普通 ==の== 人」. This is because *person B* treats "normal" as a label for a type of people, and suggests that the boyfriend belongs in that category. Let's look at a conversation where using 「普通 ==な== 人」 would be more appropriate:

- 新しい彼氏、変な人？
*Is your new boyfriend a weirdo?*

- ううん、普通 ==な== 人だよ。
*No, he's a normal person*

In this case, it was less about labeling the boyfriend, and more about his personality. For this reason, *person B* chose to use 「普通な人」, highlighting normalness as a trait that characterizes the boyfriend. 「普通の人」 is possible here too, if we decide to treat "weirdos" and "normal people" as categories of people.

**Example 2**:

1. その施設には、病気 ==の== 人が多い。
2. その施設には、病気 ==な== 人が多い。

*There are many sick people at that institution.*

In the first sentence, 「病気」 is labeling 「人」. It tells us that that the sentences applies to *people who have disease*, rather than *people who don't*. This is the typical way that 「病気」 is used to modify a noun, and has a neutral, objective tone.

On the other hand, the second sentence, 「病気」 is describing 「人」. In this (possible, but uncommon) usage, 「病気」 is treated as a quality, property, nature of those people, which sounds negative and rude. It sounds something akin to the English phrase "sick in the head". This shouldn't be a surprise if we recall what we learned in "[A is B (Adjectives)](a-and-b.md#a-is-b-adjectives)" and "[だ-engine](#-engine_1)". As a reminder, adjectives expresses nature, property, quality; the copula expresses "A belongs to the set of B".

If we choose to say 「病気な人」, then 「病気」 is acting as an adjective, therefore we're expressing a nature or quality of 「人」. We're saying that "being sick" is intrinsically a characteristic of those people (which is why it sounds negative and rude). However, if we say 「病気の人」, then we're not treating 「病気」 as a intrinsic nature of those people; we're simply labeling them with a neutral tone as "people who have disease" / "people who are sick". We're saying with a neutral tone "people who belong to the set of people who have disease".

## Basic Inflection

So far, we learned how to make simple sentences using the main wagon "A" and the engine "B", and we also learned how to describe a noun by using the engine "B". We're now ready to learn how to express those sentences in negative, past-tense, and negative past-tense. Let's remind ourselves of the three types of engines:

Engine name | Used for sentences of type:
:---: | :---:
う-engine | Verb-sentence
だ-engine | Noun-sentence + Adjective-sentence (na-adjectives)
い-engine | Adjective-sentence (i-adjectives)

In Japanese, if we want to express negative, past-tense, negative past-tense, conditional, causative, etc, **we just have to inflect the engine**. Inflection means changing part of a word (usually the ending) to express a grammatical function or attribute. For example, in English, the verb "see" can inflect into "saw", "sees", "seen" to express present/past and singular/plural, etc. In Japanese, verbs (and words in general) don't express singular/plural, but they can express a lot more than English verbs can.

For now, we will only learn how to inflect the engine to express negative, past-tense, and negative past-tense.

### Negative

To inflect into negative, we attach the **helper verb 「ない」** to the engine.

???+ info "う-engine"
    **For one-row verbs**, drop the 「る」 and attach the helper verb 「ない」. Examples:
    
    - 食べ{--る--} → 食べ{++ない++}
    - 起き{--る--} → 起き{++ない++}

    **For five-rows verbs**, change the last kana into its corresponding 「あ」 row variant and attach the helper verb 「ない」. Examples:

    - 書 ==く== → 書 ==か== {++ない++}
    - 話 ==す== → 話 ==さ== {++ない++}
    - 待 ==つ== → 待 ==た== {++ない++}
    - 死 ==ぬ== → 死 ==な== {++ない++}
    - 読 ==む== → 読 ==ま== {++ない++}
    - 知 ==る== → 知 ==ら== {++ない++}
    - 泳 ==ぐ== → 泳 ==が== {++ない++}
    - 遊 ==ぶ== → 遊 ==ば== {++ない++}

    **For five-rows verbs that specifically end in 「う」**, change the 「う」 to 「わ」 and attach the helper verb 「ない」. Examples:

    - 言 ==う== → 言 ==わ== {++ない++}
    - 思 ==う== → 思 ==わ== {++ない++}

    **Exceptions**:

    - する → し{++ない++}
    - 来る → 来{++ない++} (pronounced as くる → こ{++ない++})
    - ある → {++ない++}

    ???+ example 
        Let's look at one example sentence:

        - さくらが食べない  
        *Sakura doesn't eat*

        We already know how to describe a noun by using a verb. We can also do so if the verb is in negative:

        - ==知らない== 人と話す  
        *Talk to a person ==that (I) don't know==* / *Talk to a stranger*

???+ info "だ-engine"
    Change 「だ」 to 「では」 and attach the helper verb 「ない」. Examples:

    - 学生 ==だ== → 学生 ==では== {++ない++}
    - 静か ==だ== → 静か ==では== {++ない++}

    A more colloquial version of 「では」 is 「じゃ」.

    - 学生 ==だ== → 学生 ==じゃ== {++ない++}
    - 静か ==だ== → 静か ==じゃ== {++ない++}

    ???+ example
        Let's look at one example sentence:

        - さくらが学生じゃない  
        *Sakura is not a student*

        We can also describe a noun:

        - ==学生じゃない== さくらが勉強する  
        *Sakura ==who is not a student== studies*

???+ info "い-engine"
    Change 「い」 to 「く」 and attach the helper verb 「ない」. Examples:

    - 優し ==い== → 優し ==く== {++ない++}
    - 美味し ==い== → 美味し ==く== {++ない++}
    - 温か ==い== → 温か ==く== {++ない++}

    **Exceptions**:

    - 良 ==い== → 良 ==く== {++ない++} (pronounced as いい → よくない)

    ???+ example
        Let's look at one example sentence:

        - ラーメンが美味しくない  
        *Ramen is not delicious*

        We can also describe a noun:

        - ==優しくない== 人が怖い  
        *People ==who are not kind== are scary*

    ???+ tip Trivia
        The word 「良い」(usually written in kana only 「いい」) was originally pronounced as 「よい」. It eventually became 「いい」 but its inflection still retains the original form. Nowadays, the word 「良い」 can still be pronounced as 「よい」 but it's not common.

### Past-Tense

To inflect into past-tense, we attach the helper verb 「た」 to the engine.

???+ info "う-engine"
    **For one-row verbs**, drop the 「る」 and attach the helper verb 「た」. Examples:

    - 食べ{--る--} → 食べ{++た++}
    - 起き{--る--} → 起き{++た++}

    **For five-rows verbs**, the inflection will vary depending on the last kana, and then attach the helper verb 「た」.
    
    **〜す**

    - 話 ==す== → 話 ==し== {++た++}

    **〜く、〜ぐ**
    
    - 書 ==く== → 書 ==い== {++た++}
    - 泳 ==ぐ== → 泳 ==い== {++だ++} (Verbs that end in 「ぐ」 uses a variant of 「た」: 「だ」)

    **〜ぬ、〜む、〜ぶ** (This group uses a variant of 「た」: 「だ」)

    - 死 ==ぬ== → 死 ==ん== {++だ++}
    - 読 ==む== → 読 ==ん== {++だ++}
    - 遊 ==ぶ== → 遊 ==ん== {++だ++}

    **〜つ、〜る、〜う**

    - 待 ==つ== → 待 ==っ== {++た++}
    - 知 ==る== → 知 ==っ== {++た++}
    - 言 ==う== → 言 ==っ== {++た++}

    **Exceptions**

    - する → し{++た++}
    - 来る → 来{++た++} (pronounced as くる → きた)
    - 行く → 行っ{++た++}
    - 問う → 問う{++た++}

        Let's look at one example sentence:

        - ラーメンが美味しくない  
        *Ramen is not delicious*

        We can also describe a noun:

        - ==優しくない== 人が怖い  
        *People ==who are not kind== are scary*

???+ info "だ-engine"
    Change 「だ」 to 「だっ」 and attach the helper verb 「た」. Examples:

    - 学生 ==だ== → 学生 ==だっ== {++た++}
    - 静か ==だ== → 静か ==だっ== {++た++}

    ???+ example
        Let's look at one example:

        - さくらが学生だった  
        *Sakura was a student*

        We can also describe a noun:

        - ==子供だった== さくらが立派な大人になった  
        *Sakura ==who was a child== became a splendid adult*

???+ info "い-engine"
    Change 「い」 to 「かっ」 and attach the helper verb 「た」
    
    - 優し ==い== → 優し ==かっ== {++た++}
    - 美味し ==い== → 美味し ==かっ== {++た++}
    - 温か ==い== → 温か ==かっ== {++た++}

    **Exceptions**:

    - 良 ==い== → 良 ==かっ== {++た++} (pronounced as いい → よかった)

    ???+ example
        Let's look at one example sentence:

        -　ゲームが楽しかった  
        *Game was fun*

        We can also describe a noun:

        - ==楽しかった== 時間が戻らない
        *Time ==that was fun== won't come back*

### Negative Past-Tense

We already know how to inflect into negative with the helper verb 「ない」. Notice that 「ない」 ends with the kana 「い」. To inflect into the negative past-tense, we can treat 「ない」 as an い-engine and inflect into past-tense. In other words:

To inflect into **negative past-tense for all 3 engines**, we first inflect into negative with 「ない」, and then inflect 「ない」 into past-tense with 「た」.
