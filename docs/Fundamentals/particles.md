# Particles

## What are particles?
Let's use the following sentence to illustrate what a particle is:

Note: 「魚」 means "fish"  
「食べる」 means "eat"

- 魚 ==_== 食べる。

What is that sentence saying in English?

- Fish eats (something)
- (Something) eats fish

The answer is: it can be either one. So how do we know if "fish" is doing the "eating", or if "fish" is "being eaten"? This is where particles come into play. Particles are one or more hiragana characters that attach to the end of a word to define the grammatical function of that word in the sentence. In other words, a particle defines the "role" of a word in a sentence. Using the correct particle is very important because the meaning of a sentence can completely change just by changing the particle. 

We can finally put the knowledge from "Sentence Structures" into use. As a reminder, this is how we visualize our train analogy:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Topic 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Main wagon "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black"> - </td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black"> - </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Let's begin learning some basic particles. Each particle has more than one usage/function. We will only learn a few basic usage for each particle for now.

## Topic particles

If we follow the analogy of the train, then topic particles are the particles that go into the "Topic 🏳️" part of the train. We will learn what this actually means when we learn about the particles themselves. There are two topics particles in Japanese: 「は」 and 「も」.

### 「は」

**「は」 is the topic particle**. To follow the analogy of our hypothetical train, **「は」is like a flag**. Why do we depict it as a flag? Because that's what it does. **It flags something as the topic of the sentence**. While the kana 「は」 is normally pronounced as 「は」, it is pronounced as 「わ」 when it is being used as the topic particle.

Let's look at an example sentence:

- 私は日本人だ

literally means:

- "As for me, (I) am Japanese" 
- "Speaking of me, (I) am Japanese"
- "In relation to me, (I) am Japanese" 

To visualize this, here's how it looks by using our train analogy:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">私は 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">Main wagon "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">Engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">日本人だ</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The full sentence in Japanese is 「私はØが日本人だ」. The zero pronoun (Ø) means "I" in this context (we learned this in the "Invisible main wagon "A" section). We marked 「私」 as the topic of our sentence by attaching the 「は」 particle to it. That same sentence in English would be:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">As for me 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">Main wagon "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">Engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">I</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">am Japanese</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Now, you might ask yourself, "Isn't this overcomplicated? Can't we just pretend that 「私は」 is the main wagon "A" and translate the sentence as simply "I am Japanese?". The answer is **NO**. Although it works in this example sentence, it doesn't work in every case and that's why you shouldn't do it. When you run into sentences where "pretending that 「は」 is the main wagon" doesn't work, now you suddenly can't understand the sentence and you get lost.

To illustrate why you shouldn't pretend that the topic is the main wagon, let's take a look at the following sentence:  

*A group of friends are dining at a restaurant, and one person tells the waiter:*

- 私は魚だ

The joke is that the person has literally said "I am a fish". After all, if 「私は日本人だ」 means "I am Japanese", then 「私は魚だ」 must mean "I am a fish", right? That makes perfect sense, except that 「私は日本人だ」 doesn't actually mean "I am Japanese"; it means "As for me, (I) am Japanese". This is why it is important to not pretend that the "topic" is the main wagon "A". If we look at the train for 「私は日本人だ」:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">私は 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">Main wagon "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">Engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">日本人だ</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Ø can be assumed to be "I" based on context. However, in the case of 「私は魚だ」, the train looks like this:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">私は 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">Main wagon "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">Engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">魚だ</td>
  </tr>
</table>

where Ø means "it". What is "it"? "It" is the thing we are talking about: *what we are eating for dinner*. So, the sentence 「私は魚だ」 actually means:

- As for me, (it) is fish.

Or in normal English, we would say "I'll have the fish" or "I'll go with the fish".

To better understand what the topic particle **does** and what it **doesn't do**, let's look at another example sentence without 「は」.

Note: 「投げる」(なげる) means "throw"  
「ボール」 means "ball"

- 私がボールをさくらに投げる

Main wagon "A" | Wagon 「を」 | Wagon 「に」 | Engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
私が | ボールを | さくらに | 投げる

This sentence means "I throw a ball at Sakura" or "I throw a ball to Sakura". All three particles in this sentence -「が」,「を」and 「に」 tell us the "role" of each word that it's attached to. 「が」 tells us *who* threw the ball, 「を」 tells us *what* was thrown, 「に」 tells us *to whom* the ball was thrown.

???+ note
    We will learn more about 「が」,「を」and 「に」 in a later section.

Now that we've seen how those particles can affect the "role" of a word, let's introduce the 「は」 particle into the sentence to see what a topic particle does.

- 私はさくらにボールを投げる

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="4" style="text-align: center">私は 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">Main wagon "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">Wagon 「に」</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">Wagon 「を」</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">Engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">さくらに</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">ボールを</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">投げる</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This means "As for me, (I) throw the ball at Sakura".

We can give the flag to the "ball" instead:

- ボールは私がさくらに投げる

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="4" style="text-align: center">ボールは 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">Main wagon "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">Wagon 「に」</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">Wagon 「を」</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">Engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">私が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">さくらに</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø を</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">投げる</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This means "As for the ball, I throw (it) at Sakura". 

Notice how the logical meaning of the sentence doesn't change at all. Let us remind ourselves of the relationship between Topic-Comment and Structure-Object.

<table style="border: 1px solid black">
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">Topic</td>
    <th colspan="4" style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Comment</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Main wagon</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">「に」</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">「を」</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">ボールは</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">私が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">さくらに</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Ø を</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">投げる</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The "Topic" simply brings something up as... well, the topic of the conversation. It doesn't tell us anything *about* it. That's what the "Comment" is there for. The "Comment" is what tells us logical information. This is why the "Topic" doesn't change the logical meaning of the sentence.

**It is important to note that giving the 「は」 flag to a word can change the nuance of the sentence every so slightly**, but we don't have to worry about it for now. We will have a deeper look at these nuances in a later section.

### 「も」

**「も」 is the inclusive topic particle**. It is essentially the topic particle with the additional meaning of "also". Basically, it can introduce another topic in addition to the current topic. Its usage is best explained by an example.

- 私**も**学生だ。

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">私も 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">Main wagon "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">Engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">学生だ</td>
  </tr>
</table>

*As for me __also__, (I) am student.*

Let's look at 「も」 in dialogues:

**Example 1**

ボブ： アリスは学⽣？  
アリス： うん、トム**も**学⽣。

*Literal translation*  
Bob: As for Alice, are (you) a student?  
Alice: Yes. As for Tom **also**, (he) is a student.

*Normal English*  
Bob: Are you a student?  
Alice: Yeah, Tom is **also** student.

**The inclusion of 「も」 must be consistent with the answer**. It would not make sense to say, "I am a student, and Tom is also not a student." Instead, use the 「は」 particle to make a break from the inclusion, i.e. change the topic. Let's look at the next example.

**Example 2**

ボブ： アリスは学⽣？  
アリス： うん、でもトムは学⽣じゃない。

*Literal translation*  
Bob: As for Alice, are (you) a student?  
Alice: Yes, but, as for Tom, (he) is not.

*Normal English*  
Bob: Are you a student?  
Alice: Yeah, but Tom is not.

If the inclusion *is* consistent with the answer, then we can use 「も」.

**Example 3**

ボブ：アリスは学⽣？  
アリス：ううん、トム**も**学⽣じゃない。

*Literal trasnlation*  
Bob: As for Alice, are (you) a student?  
Alice: No, as for Tom **also**, (he) is not a student.

*Normal English*  
Bob: Are you a student?  
Alice: No, Tom is **also** not student.

## Case marking particles

Case marking particles (「格助詞」 in Japanese) are particles that mark the role of a word in a sentence.

### 「が」

**「が」 is the identifier particle**. What do I mean by that? Let's say I want to ask "Who is the student?". If I use the topic particle 「は」, the question would become 

Note: 「誰」（だれ） means "who"

- 誰は学生？

*"As for who, is (it) a student?"*

and that doesn't make any sense because "who" is not an actual person. This is where 「が」 comes into play. We already learned from the "*Main wagon "A"*" section that 「が」 attaches to a word to mark it as the main wagon "A". 

Suppose the student is "Alice". Then, we can say "Alice is student" like so:

- アリスが学生だ

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
アリスが | 学生だ

But if we are asking the question "Who is the student?", that means we don't know what is inside the main carriage "A". It means that the main wagon "A" is unknown. To illustrate:

Main wagon "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
❓ が | 学生

So, all we need to do is put 「誰」 in the main wagon. The question now becomes:

- 誰が学生？

*Who is student?*

Makes sense right? The 「が」 particle marks the main wagon "A". It marks the subject. It marks the doer. It tells us *who*/*what* is doing/being "B". But didn't we say earlier that the particle 「が」 is the **identifier particle**?. That's right. The particle 「が」 marks the main wagon "A", therefore it tells us *who*/*what* is doing/being "B". It **identifies** "A" for us.

Let's look at an example:

- ボブ：誰が学⽣？  
*Bob: Who is the one that is student?*  

- アリス：ジョンが学⽣。  
*Alice: John is the one that is student*

Bob wants to identify *who* -among all the possible candidates- is a student. Alice responds that *John* is the one. Notice that Alice could also have answered with the topic particle to indicate that, "Speaking of John", she knows that he is **a** student (maybe not **the** student that Bob is looking for). Let's illustrate this difference again. If Bob asks:

- ボブ：誰が学⽣？  
*Bob: Who is the one that is student?* 

Then Alice can answer in two ways:

- アリス：ジョンが学⽣。  
*Alice: John is the one that is student.*

- アリス：ジョンは学⽣。  
*Alice: As for John, (he) is student. (As for other people, they could be students too.*

It is helpful to translate 「は」 as "as for...; about...; speaking of...; in relation to..." and 「が」 as "the one; the thing" to illustrate the difference.

Let's look at one more example:

1. 私は学⽣。  
*As for me, (I am) student.*

2. 私が学⽣。  
*I (am) the one (that is) student.*

The 「は」 and 「が」 particles are actually quite different if we use the train analogy to illustrate the sentence. 

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">私は 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">Main wagon "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">Engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">学生だ</td>
  </tr>
</table>


The 「が」 particle identifies a specific entity as *the* thing while the 「は」 particle is used only to bring up a new topic of conversation. This is why, in longer sentences, it is common to separate the topic with commas to remove ambiguity about which part of the sentence the topic applies to.

### 「を」

**「を」 is the direct object particle**. Essentially, it marks *what* the verb is *"verb"'ing* to. The kana 「を」 is essentially never used anywhere else. The kana 「を」 , while technically pronounced as 「を」 essentially sounds like 「お」 in real speech. Here are some examples setences:

Note: 「魚」（さかな） means "fish" 
「食べる」（たべる）＝ eat  
「ジュース」 means "juice"  
「飲む」（のむ）＝ drink

- ⿂を⾷べる。

Main wagon "A" | Wagon 「を」 | Engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---:
Ø | ⿂を | ⾷べる

*Eat fish*

The verb is 「食べる」 which means "eat". *What* is being eaten? The 「魚」.  

- ジュースを飲む。

Main wagon "A" | Wagon 「を」 | Engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---:
Ø | ジュースを | 飲む

*Drink juice*

The verb is 「飲む」 which means "drink". *What* is being drunk? The 「ジュース」.

Some more examples:

- 本を読む。  
*Read book*

- 日本語を勉強する。  
*Study Japanese*

- アニメを見る。  
*Watch anime*

- ケーキを作る。  
*Make cake*

- パソコンを使う。  
*Use computer*

Unlike the direct object in English, places can also be the direct object of certain motion verbs. However, as you can see by the next examples, it often translates to something different in English due to the slight difference of the concept of direct object.

- 街を歩く。  
*Walk through street.* 

- ⾼速道路を⾛る。  
*Run through expressway.* 

- 自宅を出る。
*Leave the house.* 

- 空を飛ぶ。  
*Fly through the sky.*

- 電車を降りる。  
*Get off the train.*

- 横断歩道を渡る。  
*Cross over crosswalk.* / *Cross over pedestrian crossing.*

### 「に」

**「に」 is the target particle**. "Target" can mean any of the following:

1. spatial location for *stative* verbs such as "to be" or "to live, to inhabit".
2. temporal location for numerical times
3. direction for motion verbs
4. indirect object (recipient of an action)
5. result
6. purpose or intention

**1. Spatial location for stative verbs**

- 日本に住んでいる。  
*Live in Japan*

- 家にいる。  
*Be at home*

**2. Temporal locations for numerical times**

Can be used for "specific point in time"

- 1時に食べる。  
*Eat at one o'clock*

- 3年生の3月にある就活のイベント。  
*Job hunting event in March of junior year*

Can be used for "duration of time"

- 1週間に1回シャワーする。  
*Shower once a week*

- 1年間に２回引っ越しする。  
*Move houses twice a year*

**3. Direction for motion verbs**

- 学校に行く。    
*Go to school*

- 家に帰る。  
*Go back home*

- 山に登る。  
*Climb up mountain*

- 電車に乗る。
*Get on train*

- 駅に着く。  
*Arrived at station*

**4. Indirect object (recipient of action)**

- 友達に花をあげる。  
*Give flowers to friend*

- さくらにボールを投げる。  
*Throw ball at/to Sakura*

- 友達に会う。  
*Meet friend*

**5. Result**

- 医者になる。  
*Become doctor*

**6. Purpose or intention**

- 映画を見に行く。  
*Go see a movie*

**7. Cause or origin or reason**

- 病気に苦しむ。  
*Suffer from sickness*

**8. Comparison standard**

- 母に似てる。  
*Resembles mother*

???+ warning
    While we can use 「に」 for specific points in time, such as:
    
    - 1 o'clock
    - March
    - 15th (day of month)
    
    and also for duration of time, such as:

    - 1 week
    - 3 year
    - 2 months

    we **can't use 「に」 for relative time**, such as:

    - tomorrow
    - yesterday
    - today
    - last week
    - next month

### 「から」 and 「まで」

We can express "**from**" and "**until**" with the particles 「**から**」 and 「**まで**」, respectively.

**Example of spatial location**:

- アリスは、アメリカから来る。  
*Alice comes from America.*

- 学校から家まで歩く。  
*Walk from school to home.*

**Example of temporal location**:

- 今⽇から明⽇まで宿題をする。  
*Do homework from today until tomorrow.*

- 1時から始まった。  
*Started from 1 o'clock.*

### 「へ」

**「へ」 is the directional particle**. The particle 「へ」 is exactly like the particle 「に」 but only in its usage for marking direction of motion. 「へ」 is normally pronounced /he/, when it is being used as a particle, it is always pronounced /e/ (え). 


- ボブは⽇本へ⾏く。  
*Bob goes towards Japan.*

- 家へ帰る。  
*Go back toward house.*

- 部屋へ来る。  
*Come towards room*

- 勝ちへ向かう。  
*Go towards victory*

- 日本へようこそ！
*Welcome to Japan*

- ❌ 医者へなる。  
(Grammatically incorrect version of 「医者になる」.)

### 「で」

**「で」 is the contextual/boundary particle**. It allows us to specify the context or boundary in which the action is performed. It can also be called the instrumental particle. It is used to indicate *what* is the "instrument" or "means by" or "with which" the subject achieves or accomplishes an action. For example, if a person ate a fish, where did he eat it? If a person went to school, by what means did she go? With what will you eat the soup? All of these questions can be answered with the 「で」 particle. Here are some examples.

1. **映画館で⾒た。**  
_Saw (a movie) **at** the movie theater._  
(The action "see a movie" was done within the boundaries of a movie theather.)

2. **バスで帰る。**  
_Go home **by** bus._  
(The action "go home" was done within the boundaries of a "bus".)

3. **レストランで昼ご飯を⾷べた。**  
_Ate lunch **at** restaurant._  
(The action "eat lunch" was done within the boundaries of a "restaurant".)

4. **愛でご飯を作る。**  
_Make food **with** love._    
(The action "make food" is done by the means of "love".)

5. **一人で泣いた。**  
_(I/He/She) cried **by** myself/himself/herself._  
(The action "cry" was done within the boundaries of "oneself". No one else was inside that boundary.)

6. **世界で一番高いビル。**  
_Tallest building **in** the world._  
(The "building" is within the boundaries of "world".)

7. **全国で一番高いビル。**  
_Tallest building **in** the nation/country._  
(The "building" is within the boundaries of "nation/country". We're not talking about buildings that are ousdie of the country. We're only talking about bulidings within the country.)

8. **みんなで行く。**  
_Go **with** everyone._  
(The action "go" is done within the boundaries of "everyone".)

9. **お箸で食べる。**  
_Eat **with** chopsticks._  
(the action "eat" is done with the instrument "chopsticks".)

### 「の」

**「の」 is the noun modifier particle**. It marks a word (usually a noun) as modifying another word (also usually another noun), thus indicating an attributive relationship of one noun to the other noun. 

- ボブは、アメリカの⼤学の学⽣だ。  
Lit: Bob is student of college of America.

In normal English, this would translate to, "Bob is a student of an American college." The order of modification is backwards so "Bob is a student of a college that is American". In this example, 「⼤学」 is modifying 「学⽣」, and 「アメリカ」 is modifying 「⼤学」.

The particle 「の」 can also be used as a possessive particle. The equivalent of this specific usage in English is the apostrophe *'s*.

- ボブの本  
Bob's book / Book of Bob

- 私の本  
My book / Book of mine

- 私の友達
My friend / Friend of mine

The noun that is being modified (i.e. the word after the 「の」) can be omitted if the context clearly indicates what is being omitted. The following words in bold can be omitted.

1. そのシャツは誰の**シャツ**？  
Whose shirt is that shirt?

2. ボブの**シャツ**だ。  
It is shirt of Bob. / It is Bob's shirt.

to become:

1. そのシャツは誰**の**？  
Whose shirt is that?

2. ボブ**の**だ。  
It is of Bob. / It is Bob's.

Another example of omission is to change this:

1. パソコン壊れた？  
*Did your computer break?*

2. うん、でも新しい**パソコン**を買った。  
_Yeah, but I bought a new **computer**._

into this:

1. パソコン壊れた？  
*Did your computer break?*

2. うん、でも新しい**の**を買った。  
_Yeah, but I bought a new **one**._

More examples of omission:

1. ケーキ食べてみた？  
_Did you try the cakes?_

2. うん。イチゴ**の**は美味しかったけど、チョコ**の**はあんまり。  
_Yeah. The strawberry **one** was delicious but the chocolate **one** not so much._

### 「と」

### 「や」「とか」

## Contrasts

### 「は」 vs 「も」

We learned in the previoius section that:

???+ quote
    The inclusion of 「も」 must be consistent with the answer.

Let's revisit that statement and see what it actually means.

???+ info "The main difference between 「は」 and 「も」"
    - 「は」 changes the topic, and implies that the comment of the new topic is **different** from the comment of the old topic.

    - 「も」 also changes the topoic, but it implies that the comment of the new topic is the **same** as the comment of the old topic.

*That* is what I meant by "consistent".

Suppose we have a first topic "Alice", and the comment about her is "is student":

- アリスは学生だ。  
*As for Alice, is student.*

We also have a second topic "Tom", and the comment about him is "is student":

- トムは学生だ。  
*As for Tom, is student.*

Then, we **can** use 「も」 in the second topic, because the *comment* of both topics are the same.

- アリスは学生だ。
- トム**も**学生だ。

???+ warning "Be careful how you use 「は」 and 「も」 in certain phrases"

    For example, the following phrase is often said when greeting someone during New Year:

    Note: 「今年」（ことし）＝ this year

    - 「今年**も**よろしくお願いします。」

    A very rough translation of this phrase in English can be 

    - "Once again this year, please be good to me"
    - "Once again this year, I'm looking forward to working with you" 

    Let us remind ourselves that the particle 「は」:

    > implies that the comment of the new topic is **different** from the comment of the old topic

    So, if we say 「今年は。。。」, we're implying that "this year is different from previous years". In other words, it implies that your relationship with that person in previous years was not a successful one. It implies that the relationship in previous years was not pleasant for you. You're essentially saying, "This year, **as opposed to previous years**, I'll be looking forward to working with you".

    This is why the correct way of saying the phrase is 「今年**も**よろしくお願いします」 because you want to express "this year too".

### 「は」 vs 「が」

Now that we learned about the grammatical usage of 「は」 and 「が」, it might still be a little bit confusing for some people. Unlike English, which is a very Subject-Object oriented language, **Japanese is a very Topic-Comment oriented language**. This is why you see 「は」 more often than 「が」 in a normal sentence like "A is B".

Let's explain the difference between 「は」 and 「が」 again, but not from the perspective of grammar, but from the perspective of communication/conversation. *How do native speakers use those particles?*

???+ info "The main difference bewtween 「は」 and 「が」"

    - 「は」 talks about **something in general**.
    - 「が」 **singles something out**  to say "that is *the thing*".

There are more nuances between 「は」 and 「が」. Let's look at a few examples to understand these nuances.

**Example 1**:

Grammatically speaking, the following two sentences are correct.

Note: 「これ」＝ this  
「携帯」（けいたい）＝ cellphone

- これ**は**携帯だ。  
*As for this, (it) is cellphone.*

- これ**が**携帯だ。  
*This is the thing that is cellphone.*

Both sentences are generally translated the same way into normal English as: "This is a cellphone".

But the one that is used more often is 「これは携帯だ」. When you want to say that **something is different compared to other things**, you use 「が」. If there is literally only one cellphone in the entire world, saying 「これが携帯だ」 would be incorrect, because there are no other cellphones to compare it with.

**「が」 is really only used when you are making a "comparison"**. 

**Example 2**:

- ⭕ 誰**が**学⽣？
- ❌ 誰**は**学⽣？

The question is asking "Who is a student?".

The first question 「誰が学⽣？」 is grammatically correct, while the second question 「誰は学⽣？」 is not. In this example, there are many people who could be a student, and you want to know *who* is a student among them. You are comparing all those candidates to each other, and then choosing one person and saying "*that* is the student". Comparing in this manner is the only way 「が」 is used. This is why if you use 「が」 in a normal statement like "A is B", **it can sound very bossy**.

**Example 3**:

If you want to say "I am a medical student", normally you would say:

Note: 「医学生」（いがくせい）＝ medical student

- 私**は**医学生だ。

but if you say this instead:

- 私**が**医学生だ。

you will end up implying *"He's not a medical student. She's also not a medical student. Then who is the medical student here? That's right. __I am__ the medical student. I am differrent from the other students"*. You are essentially comparing yourself to the other students and saying "**I am** the medical student". You will end up putting too much emphasis on 「私」 and you will sound very rude.

**Example 4**:

This is also why during self-introduction, you should say:

- 私**は**さくらだ。  
(This still sounds unnatural and disrespectful, but for other reasons that we haven't looked at yet.)

However, if you say this during self-introduction:

- 私**が**さくらだ。

you will end up sounding like "I am **the** Sakura. I am the Sakura that **everyone knows about**. That's **me**".

**Example 5**:

In a certain way, 「は」 works like the English word "*the*", but only in this one respect, that it can't mark **new information**. To illustrate this "old information" vs "new information" concept, let's look at some examples of the English word "the". If we say:

- I fed the iguana.

unless people already know about this iguana, their immediate thought is going to be "What iguana? You never talked about any iguana before. What do you mean *the* iguana?". But if we say:

- I fed an iguana.

that's alright. However, you can in fact say:

- I fed the dog.

without anybody knowing that you even had a dog, because it's very *normal and natural* for a person to have a dog. It not necessary to "introduce" the dog into the conversation first to then say "the dog". But if I said "I fed the iguana", that's a conversation stopper, isn't it? If I don't introduce the iguana first, nobody is just going to assume that I have an iguana at home as pet, because it's not common. So, while we say "new information" vs "old information", it's actually a bit more subtler than that. It's actually "new, important and relevant information" vs "old information or information that can be commonly agreed on".

**Example 6**:

Another example of "old information" vs "new information":

Note: 「昔々」（むかしむかし）＝ once upon a time / long time ago  
「姫」（ひめ）＝ princess  
「美しい」（うつくしい）＝ beautiful

- 「昔々姫**が**いた。姫**は**美しかった。」  
*Once upon a time, there was __a__ princess. __The__ princess was beautiful.*

Notice that in the first sentence 「が」 was used, and in the second sentence 「は」 was used. But didn't we just learn that 「が」 is used for comparison? So who are we comparing 「姫」 to? We are essentially saying: 

*"Once upon a time, there was a __princess__. Not a prince, not a queen, not a farmer, but a princess. The princess is the focus of the story".*

"Princess" is someone we didn't know yet. "Princess" is "new information". We were introducing her for the first time in the story. After introducing the princess, we can now say 「姫**は**。。。」 as in "**The** princess..." because "princess" is now "old information". If we don't first introduce the princess in the first sentence and go straight to the second sentence "As for **the** princess, ...", you as the reader might wonder "*As for the princess? What princess? Which princess are we talking about specifically?*".

**Example 7**:

「が」 can also mark particularities as opposed to generalities. For example, if we say:

- 花**は**きれいだ

it's likely that we're saying 

- Flowers (in general) are pretty. 

But if we say:

- 花**が**きれいだ

we're stressing 「花」 as the subject. We're emphasizing 「花」 to mean:

- The flower/these flowers (in particular) is/are pretty.

**Example 8**:

Let's look at another example. Suppose you are with a friend who has never seen what a ramen looks like. There are three dishes in front of you two: sushi, curry rice, and ramen. When you point at the ramen to let your friend know that *that* is ramen, you can say:

- あれ**が**ラーメン

Using 「が」 in this manner implies "*That* (sushi) is not ramen. *That* (curry rice) is also not ramen. *That* (ramen) is ramen".

**Example 9**:

Another example that might not seem as straightforward to understand is this sentence:

- 私**が**高校生の時サッカーが好きだった

This sentence roughly translates to "I liked playing soccer when I was in highschool". This sentence might look too complicated for someone who just started learning Japanese. But the point I want to make is that 「が」 was used in the sentence, instead of 「は」. Earlier, we learned that 「が」 is only used for comparison. So who are we comparing 「私」 to? We are comparing "myself" to "myself". More accurately, we are comparing the "present me" to the "past me" or "the highschool me".

???+ info "Another way to look at the difference between 「は」 and 「が」"
    - 「は」 puts the emphasis on the sentence **after** it
    - 「が」 puts the emphasis on the sentence **before** it.
    
    This makes sense if we look at what we learned at the beginning of this section:
    > Japanese is a very Topic-Comment oriented language.

    which is why a sentence like "A is B" usually use 「は」. 

To illustrate this change of emphasis, let's look at the following 3 sentences:

Note: 「本」（ほん）＝ book  
（買う）（かう）＝ buy

1. 本を買った。
2. 私は本を買った。
3. 私が本を買った。

In the **first sentence**, it doesn't put any particular emphasis on anything; it's just saying, neutrally, "I bought a book". 

If we choose to stress "I" as the topic and say the **second sentence**, we're changing the topic to "I" and saying that "I bought a book". The particle 「は」, aside from marking something as the topic, it also implies that the "*comment*" on said topic is different from the comment on "old topics" or on "other topics" (we learned this in the section about 「は」 vs 「も」). In other words, we are implying:

"*__I__ bought a book. __You__ may have bought something else. __Other people__ may not have bought anything at all. __Other people__ may have also bought a book, but I don't know about it. All I know is that __I__ bought a book. *".

The second sentence is implicitly answering the question "**What did I do?**" The answer is "I *bought a book*".

Now, if we say the **third sentence**, we've now changed the emphasis. Under what circumstances do we say the third sentence? Suppose that people are looking at an empty bookshelf and wondering who bought the last book, and you say 「私**が**本を買った」. In other words, you're saying "**I am the one** who bought the book". We all know and see that the bookshelf is empty, so "buying the book" is "old information". People want to know the "new information"; people want to know **who** bought the book, which is why you should answer with 「私**が**本を買った」. 

While the second sentence is implicitly answering the question "What did I do?", the third sentence is implicitly answering the question "**Who bought the book?**" The answer is "*I am the one* who bought the book".

???+ note
    The last three examples sentences that we just looked at:

    1. 本を買った。
    2. 私は本を買った。
    3. 私が本を買った。

    in "full sentence" are actually :

    1. ØはØが本を買った。
    2. 私はØが本を買った。
    3. Øは私が本を買った。

    Japanese grammar allows you to omit the topic and the subject (main wagon "A"). In fact the only component needed to make a complete and proper sentence is the engine "B". This means that, when we choose to explicitly say the topic or the subject out loud, we do so because we want to say it with a certain nuance, or with a certain emphasis.

???+ info "The English equivalent of 「が」"
    Japanese is a topic-prominent language, which is why there is one particle for topic (「は」) and one for subject (「が」) . This allows Japanese speakers to emphasize either the topic or the subject, by simply using the corresponding particle.

    English, on the other hand, is subject-prominent language. On top of that, English doesn't use particles. In English, when we want to express "emphasis on the subject" the same way 「が」 does in Japanese, we would usually do it in these two ways:

    1. I am the one who bought the book.
    2. *I* bought the book.
    3. **I** bought the book.

    The first way is to explicitly say "I am the one who..." or "she is the one who..." or "they are the ones who..." or "this is the thing that...".

    The second way is to -if it's on text- stylize the "I" with italics or with bold (or both). The equivalent of this in spoken speech is to say "I" louder or longer (or both).

    **On a related note**: If we want to *interpret* (not to be confused with *translate*) the following Japanese sentence into English, while still retaining all the nuances and emphasis as much as possible, this is how it would probably be said in English.

    - 私は日本人だ。  
    *I am Japanese.*

    Notice that in Japanese, 「私」 is marked with the topic particle 「は」. But the interpretation in English, "I" is the subject, not the topic. Now, let's look at the next sentence:

    - 私が日本人だ。  
    *I am the one who is Japanese.*

    Because normal English sentences is already subject-prominent, when we want to emphasize on the subject the same way 「が」 does in Japanese, we end up resorting to phrases like "the one" or "the thing".

???+ tip
    The difference between these two particles will become more apparent and easier to tell apart as you do more *immersion* (if you don't know what I mean by immersion, refer back to the Getting Started section).

### 「に」 vs 「へ」

The primary difference between the 「に」 and 「へ」 particle when used with motion verbs is that 「に」 goes to a target as the final, intended destination (both physical or abstract). The 「へ」 particle, on the other hand, is used to express the fact that one is setting out towards the direction of the target. As a result, it is only used with directional motion verbs. It also does not guarantee whether the target is the final intended destination, only that one is heading towards that direction. In other words, the 「に」 particle sticks to the destination while the 「へ」 particle is fuzzy about where one is ultimately headed. For example, if
we choose to replace 「に」 with 「へ」 in the examples from the section about 「に」 particle, the nuance changes slightly.
