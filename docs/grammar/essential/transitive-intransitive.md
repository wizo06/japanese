# Transitive vs Intransitive verbs

## What are they?

Verbs can be classified into transitive (他動詞) and intransitive (自動詞).

!!! info "Transitive"
    Transitive verbs are used when the action is done *TO* something. Example:

    - I ==started== {++the engine of the car++}.

    Here, the action is "==started==", and it's being done TO {++the engine of the car++}.

!!! info "Intransitive"
    Intransitive verbs are used when the action is NOT done *to* something. Example:

    - The meeting ==started== at 5 o'clock.

    Here, the action is also "==started==", but it's not being done to anything. In other words, "the meeting" did not start something else; "the meeting" itself started.

## Comparison

Let's look at some more examples to better see the difference.

!!! example
    1. The ball ==dropped==
    2. You ==dropped== {++the ball++}

    In the first sentence, "the ball" didn't drop anything; "the ball" itself dropped. In other words, "dropped" is intransitive here.

    In the second sentence, "you" dropped "the ball"; "you" itself didn't drop. In other words, "dropped" is transitive here. The action "dropped" is being done *to* "the ball".

!!! example
    In English, sometimes the verb will change.

    1. You ==put== {++the milk++} ==in== the refrigerator
    2. The milk ==entered== the refrigerator

    In the first sentence, "you" put in "the milk" in the refrigerator; "you" itself didn't go into the refrigerator. The action "put in" is being done *to* "the milk".

    In the second sentence, "the milk" didn't put anything in the refrigerator; "the milk" itself entered the refrigerator.

!!! example
    1. The shop ==opens== at 7 o'clock.
    2. The owner ==opens== {++the shop++} at 7 o'clock.

    In the first sentence, "the shop" is not opening anything; "the shop" itself opens at 7 o'clock.

    In the second sentence, "the owner" opens "the shop" at 7 o'clock; "the owner" itself is not opening. The action "open" is being done *to* "the shop".

## In Japanese

In Japanese, verbs **usually** come in pairs. One for transitive, one for intransitive. Examples:

Transitive | Intransitive
:---: | :---:
落とす | 落ちる
出す | 出る
入れる | 入る
開ける | 開く
閉める | 閉まる
付ける | 付く
消す | 消える
抜く | 抜ける
決める | 決まる
始める | 始まる
終える | 終わる
燃やす | 燃える
乾かす | 乾く
起こす | 起きる
動かす | 動く

Let's look at some example sentences:

- 妻が {++夫を++} ==起こした==  
The wife ==woke up== {++the husband++}

- 妻が ==起きた==  
The wife ==woke up==

- 夫が ==起きた==  
The husband ==woke up==

- {++髪の毛を++} ==乾かす==  
==To dry== {++hair++}

- 髪の毛が ==乾く==  
The hair ==dries==

- 店が７時に ==開く==  
The store ==opens== at 7 o'clock

- 店員さんが{++店を++}７時に ==開ける==  
The store employee ==opens== {++the store++} at 7 o'clock

- {++机を++} ==動かす==  
==To move== {++the desk++}

- 机が ==動いた==  
The desk ==moved== (maybe due to earthquake or something)

Notice that I said "**usually** come in pairs" earlier. There are verbs that only have a transitive variant, there are verbs that only have an intransitive variant, and there are verbs that can be used as either variant (without the need to come in pairs).[^1]

### Only transitive

Let's look at some verbs that only come in transitive variant:

- 彼氏を ==疑う==  
==To doubt== boyfriend / ==To suspect== boyfriend

- 告白を ==断る==  
==To reject== a love confession

- 宿題を ==忘れる==  
==To forget== the homework

- 命を ==嫌う==  
==To hate== life

### Only intransitive

Let's look at some verbs that only come in intransitive variant:

- 私たちが川で ==泳ぐ==  
We ==swim== in the river

- 被害者が ==死んだ==  
The victim ==died==

- 星が ==光る==  
The star ==shines==

- 子供が ==成長する==  
The kid ==grows up==

### Can be used as either

Let's look at some verbs that can be used as either variant (without the need to come in pairs):

- 風が ==吹く==  
The wind ==blows==

- 笛を ==吹く==  
==to blow== a flute (Or in normal English: "to play the flute")

## Pay attention to the particles (or not?)

Notice that, for transitive verbs, we use the particle 「を」 to mark the word that is being affected by the action. If we recall what we learned about the particle 「を」 previously, this usage of 「を」 is from the function "marks the direct object of an action".

For intransitive verbs, we often only see 「～が + verb」.

Example:

- (〇〇が)会議を始める  
(Someone) starts the meeting

- 会議が始まる  
The meeting starts

Because of this reason, a LOT of grammar guides out there (including the ones written by Japanese people for Japanese people) will tell you that:

> Transitive verbs are always used with 「を」, while intransitive verbs are always used with 「が」.

While this statement is partially true, it's **very misleading**.

Here's an example sentence with a transitive verb, but you don't see 「を」 and only see 「が」:

- 私が(〇〇を)始める  
I start (something)

Here's an example sentence with an intransitive verb, but you don't see 「が」 and you see 「を」:

- (猫が)庭を走る  
(The cat) runs in the garden

「走る」(run) is an intransitive verb, but it's used with 「を」. Why? Because this function of 「を」 is different from the one we use for transitive verbs. Remember that each particle has many functions, and 「を」 is no exception. As we learned previously in the section about particles, the particle 「を」 can be used to mark the direct object of a *transitive* verb:

- 会議を始める
- ケーキを作る
- etc

but it can also be used to mark the physical space of movement. Verbs that expresses movement are often *intransitive*:

- 庭を走る
- 空を飛ぶ
- etc

Another reason why that misleading statement is useless: the shortest proper sentence only requires the engine "B" (as we learned previously). This means that you will run into situations where you see sentences like these:

- 始める
- 走る

Both of those sentences are complete and proper sentences in Japanese. As you can see, there is no particle at all.
