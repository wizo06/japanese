# Listing things

As we learned in the section about particles, the particle 「と」 can be used to list things in this manner:

- 机の上に ==本とペン== がある  
There is ==a book and a pen== on the desk

- ==ナイフとフォーク== でステーキを食べる  
Eat steak with ==knife and fork==

- ==本と雑誌と葉書== を買った  
Bought ==book, magazine, and post card==

When we list things using 「と」, the list is an exhaustive one, meaning that it's listing *all* the items.

If we want to make a non-exhaustive list (a partial list), we use the particle 「や」, like so:

- 机の上に ==本やペン== がある  
There is ==a book and a pen (and other things as well)== on the desk

- ==ナイフやフォーク== でステーキを食べる  
Eat steak with ==knife and fork (and other silverware as well)==

- ==本や雑誌や葉書== を買った  
Bought ==book, magazine, and post card (and other things as well)==

We can think of 「や」 as making a list with an "etc" at the end:

- There is ==a book, a pen, etc== on the desk
- Eat steak with ==knife, fork, etc==
- Bought ==book, magazine, post card, etc==

A more colloquial version of 「や」 is 「とか」:

- 机の上に ==本とかペン== がある  
- ==ナイフとかフォーク== でステーキを食べる  
- ==本とか雑誌とか葉書== を買った
