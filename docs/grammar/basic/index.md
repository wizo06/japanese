## Receptive ～れる　～られる

## Causative ～せる　～させる

## ～てあげる　～てくれる　～てもらう

（私が）（君に）してあげる means "I do it for you"
（君が）（私に）してくれる means "you do it for me"
the important detail here is the subject of the sentence. 
in 「してあげる」 the subject is 「私」. The nuance here is that 「私」 is acting on its own will, its own volition.
In 「してくれる」, the subject is 「君」. The nuance here is that 「君」 is acting on its own will, its own volition.

（私が）（君に）してもらう also translates to "you do it for me" in english, which is unfortunate because the nuance gets lost.
in this sentence, the subject is 「私」. This means that the will/volition is in 「私」.

**what does this mean in practice?**
私がXに（何かを）てもらう can be more accurately translated as "make X do （something） for me".
So, when you say お医者さんに見てもらおうかな, you're saying "make the doctor look/examine (my body/my illness) for me"
When the senpai say お前にやってもらおう to the kouhai, the senpai is saying "i'll make you (the kouhai) do this work for me"

**This is also why you can't use ～たい with くれる**
◯　洗濯やってもらいたい
Ｘ　洗濯やってくれたい
*"i want to make you do the laundry for me"*

Saying ～てもらいたい is somewhat similar to ～てほしい in this context.

**てもらう vs てくれる when asking a question**
it's possible to make a question using both てもらう and てくれる, but the nuance changes slightly.
宿題やってくれませんか？→ "will you (on your own volition) do my homework for me?"
宿題やってもらえませんか？→ "can i make you do my homework for me?" or in normal english "is it possible to have you do my homework for me?"
(notice that もらう is used in the potential form もらえる when asking questions)

**the way cure dolly explains it**
あげる is upload
くれる and もらう is download
くれる is a "push download" (the volition is on the other person)
もらう is a "pull download" (the volition is on the speaker)
