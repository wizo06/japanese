# Turn verbs into nouns

## Why turn verbs into nouns?

In a sentence like "A is B" or "A does B", the main car "A" (highlighted in yellow) is always a **noun**:

- ==Flowers== are pretty
- ==Flowers== bloom
- ==Sakura== walks
- ==Sakura== is a Japanese person
- ==That== is a rabbit
- ==The dog== runs in the garden
- etc

However, there are times where we want to talk about a **verb** in the main car "A":

- ==Studying== is hard
- ==Exercising== is tiresome
- ==Eating the same thing everyday== is not good
- ==Doing homework== is annoying
- etc

To be able to do this in Japanese, we simply turn the verb into a noun. In fact, this is what we do in English too. In English, there's at least two ways to turn a verb into a noun.

The first way is to conjugate the verb into "~ing". For example:

- ==Studying== is hard

Another way to convert a verb into a noun, is to say "to + verb", as in:

- ==To study== is to suffer.

## How to turn verbs into nouns?

So, how do we convert verbs into nouns in Japanese? We attach 「の」 or 「こと」 to the end of the verb.

**Example 1**

- 毎日 ==勉強するの== が大変だ  
==Studying== everyday is tough

Main car "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
毎日 ==勉強するの== が | 大変だ  

**Example 2**

- 毎日同じものを ==食べるの== が良くない  
==Eating== the same thing everyday is not good

Main car "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
毎日同じものを ==食べるの== が | 良くない  

**Example 3**

The verb that has been turn into a noun, doesn't have to be the main car "A". For example:

- 授業に ==行くこと== を忘れた  
(I) forgot ==to go to class==

Main car "A" | 「を」 | Engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---:
Ø が | 授業に ==行くこと== を | 忘れた  

## 「の」 vs 「こと」
