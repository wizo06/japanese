# Relative clauses

The goal of this section is to simply formally introduce the concept that: the "**description**" that we learned in an earlier section, is really just **the engine of a complete sentence on its own**.

In the section about description, we already learned how to describe a noun. For example:

1. ==泣いてる== {++さくら++}
2. ==優しい== {++さくら++}
3. ==親切な== {++さくら++}
4. ==学生の== {++さくら++}

and we also learned that we can make the "description" as long as we want to:

- ==好きな人に振られたから昨日部屋の中でずっと泣いてた== {++アリス++}
- ==手を伸ばし抱き止めた激しい== {++光++}

As you can probably see, the "description" is a sentence on its own. The "description" (highlighted in yellow) from examples #1~#4 are also sentences on their own, but we are only seeing the engine. Like we learned previously, the shortest proper sentence in Japanese only requires the engine.

Let's look at this following sentence:

- 月曜日に友達がパン屋さんで買った  
Friend bought at the bakery shop on Monday

「に」 | Main car "A" | 「で」 | Engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
月曜日に | 友達が | パン屋さんで | 買った

This entire sentence can be used to describe a noun:

- ==月曜日に友達がパン屋さんで買った== ケーキ  
The cake ==that friend bought at the bakery shop on Monday==

This sentence can also be reduced down to only the engine (again, the shortest proper sentence in Japanese only requires the engine "B"):

- ==買った== ケーキ  
The cake ==(that someone) bought==

Now, let's suppose we want to express "The cake is delicious" in Japanese:

- ケーキが美味しい  
The cake is delicious

Main car "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
ケーキが | 美味しい  

This is an "A is B" sentence. Very straightforward. The 「ケーキ」(cake) is the main car "A" in this sentence, so if we want to describe it, we would put the description before it. If the description happens to be a very long sentence, then that very long sentence will go before 「ケーキ」.

- ==月曜日に友達がパン屋さんで買った== ケーキが美味しい  
The cake ==that friend bought at the bakery shop on Monday== is delicious

Main car "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
==月曜日に友達がパン屋さんで買った== ケーキが | 美味しい  

The description itself is really just its own complete sentence:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="4" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">Clause</th>
    <th rowspan="2" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">Main car "A"</th>
    <th rowspan="2" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">Engine "B"</th>

    <th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">Main car "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">「で」</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">Engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">月曜日に</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">友達が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">パン屋さんで</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">買った</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">ケーキが</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">美味しい</td>
  </tr>
</table>

We still haven't explained the title of this section: "relative clause". So, **what is a clause?** As we can see in the table above, a clause is really just a sentence. To put it in layman's terms, a clause is a sentence inside a bigger sentence.  A relative clause simply means that the clause is describing a noun.

Let's look at another example:

- 猫が ==今朝買った新鮮な== {++魚++}を食べた  
The cat ate {++the ==fresh== fish++} ==that (we) bought this morning==

Main car "A" | 「を」 | Engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---:
猫が | ==今朝買った新鮮な== {++魚++}を | 食べた

The relative clause (highlighted in yellow) is describing 「魚」(fish).

Two things that I would like to point out here:

1. We already learned this before, but allow me to point it out again: notice that the word "fresh" is said before "fish", but "that (we) bought this morning" is said after "fish", even though all these words are describing "fish". In Japanese, this doesn't happen. As we learned in the section about word order, ALL description must go BEFORE the word that they describe. As we can see, 「新鮮」 and 「今朝買った」 go before 「魚」.

2. Notice that the description has two engines: 「買った」(う-engine) and 「新鮮」(だ-engine). The う-engine always comes before other engines. 

We can also see this happening in a previous example sentence from a while back:

- ==手を伸ばし抱き止めた激しい== {++光++}  
{++The ==bursting== light++} ==that I reached out for and held so close==

There is the う-engine for 「抱き止めた」, and it went before the い-engine for 「激しい」.
