# Description

## Describing noun

So far, we learned how to express simple sentences like these:

Japanese | English | Sentence type | Engine name
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
さくらが泣く | Sakura cries | A does B (Verbs) | う-engine
さくらが優しい | Sakura is kind | A is B (Adjectives) | い-engine
さくらが親切だ | Sakura is friendly | A is B (Adjectives) | だ-engine
さくらが学生だ | Sakura is a student | A is B (Nouns) | だ-engine

Now, let's start describing nouns by using other words, like so:

- ==Crying== Sakura / Sakura ==who is crying==
- ==Kind== Sakura / Sakura ==who is kind==
- ==Friendly== Sakura / Sakura ==who is friendly==
- Sakura ==who is a student==

In these examples, I've highlighted the "descriptive words" in yellow. All these descriptive words are describing a noun: "Sakura".

We can make these descriptions as long as we want to. Example:

- ==好きな人に振られたから昨日部屋の中でずっと泣いてた== {++アリス++}が今はみんなの前で笑ってる。  
{++Alice++}, ==who was crying the whole time in her room yesterday because she got rejected by her crush==, is now smiling in front of everyone.

Notice that the core of the sentence is just:

Main car "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
アリスが | 笑ってる
Alice | is smiling

and the descriptive words (highlighted in yellow) are just describing "Alice".

We can describe a noun by using another word. Let's call this "another word" as "descriptive word". This "descriptive word" can be: a verb, an adjective (i-adjective and na-adjective), or another noun. Notice that all of them are related to one of the three engines.

To describe a noun in Japanese, we simply place the "descriptive word" **before** the noun. In other words, we place the engine before the noun. Let's look at how this is done for each engine.

### Using a verb

We already know how to say:

- さくらが歩く。  
*Sakura walks.*

But if we want to describe Sakura by saying:

- Sakura who walks

then we place 「歩く」 before 「さくら」, like so:

- 歩くさくら

Examples of verbs (highlighted) describing a noun:

Japanese | English
:---: | :---:
==話す== 先生 | Teacher ==who talks==
==泳ぐ== 友達 | Friend ==who swims==
==食べる== 犬 | Dog ==that eats==

Let's look at some examples in sentences:

**Example 1**:

- ==泣いてる== さくらが悲しい。

Main car "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
==泣いてる== さくらが | 悲しい

In this sentence, 「泣いてる」 means "crying", and 「悲しい」 means "is sad". So, the full sentence reads:

- ==Crying== Sakura is sad.

Notice how we are using the verb "cry" to describe the noun "Sakura".

**Example 2**:

- ==運動した== 女の子が休んでる。

Main car "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
==運動した== 女の子が | 休んでる

In this sentence, 「運動した」 means "worked out / exercised", 「女の子」 means "girl", and 「休んでる」 means "resting". So, the full sentence reads:

- Girl ==who excersied== is resting.

Notice how we are using the verb "exercise" to describe the noun "Sakura".

**Example 3**:

- ==教科書を食べた== 犬がやんちゃだ。

Main car "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
==教科書を食べた== 犬が | やんちゃだ

In this sentence, 「教科書」 means "textbook", 「食べた」 means "ate", 「犬」 means "dog", and 「やんちゃ」 means "mischievous". So, the full sentence reads:

- Dog ==who ate the textbook== is mischievous.

Notice how we are using the verb "eat" to describe the noun "dog".

### Using an adjective

#### i-adjective

We already know how to say:

- さくらが優しい。  
*Sakura is kind*

But if we want to describe Sakura by saying:

- Kind Sakura / Sakura who is kind

then we place 「優しい」 before of 「さくら」, like so:

- 優しいさくら

Examples of "i-adjectives" (highlighted) describing a noun:

Japanese | English
:---: | :---:
==青い== 空 | ==Blue== sky
==明るい== 星 | ==Bright== stars
==美味しい== 寿司 | ==Delicious== sushi
==美しい== 姫 | ==Beautiful== princess
==赤い== ペン | ==Red== pen
==優しい== 彗星 | ==Gentle== comet

!!! tip "Did you know"
    「優しい彗星」 is the name of a song from the duo YOASOBI. Great song by the way.

Let's look at some examples in sentences:

**Example 1**:

- ==激しい== 運動が危ない。

Main car "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
==激しい== 運動が | 危ない

*==Extreme== exercises are dangerous.*

**Example 2**:

- ==優しい== アリスが ==可愛い== 女の子だ。

Main car "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
==優しい== アリスが | ==可愛い== 女の子だ

*==Kind== Alice is ==cute== girl.*

**Example 3**:

- ==白い== 馬が走る。

Main car "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
==白い== 馬が | 走る

*==White== horse runs.*

#### na-adjective

We already know how to say:

- さくらが親切だ。  
*Sakura is friendly*

But if we want to describe Sakura by saying:

- Friendly Sakura / Sakura who is friendly

then we place 「親切」 before 「さくら」, like so:

- 親切 ==な== さくら

!!! warning "Pay attention to the kana 「な」"
    When a na-adjective is describing a noun, we use the kana 「な」 to connect the them (hence the name na-adjectives).

Examples of na-adjectives (highlighted) describing a noun:

Japanese | English
:---: | :---:
==有名== な英雄 | ==Famous== hero
==綺麗== な花 | ==Beautiful== flowers
==特別== な日 | ==Special== day
==好き== な食べ物 | ==Favorite== food
==静か== な街 | ==Quiet== street
==便利== な場所 | ==Convenient== place
==上手== な学生 | ==Skillful== student
==必要== な書類 | ==Necessary== documents

Let's look at some examples in sentences:

**Example 1**:

- ==有名== な女優が来る。

Main car "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
==有名== な女優が | 来る

In this sentence, 「有名」 means "famous", 「女優」 means "actress", 「来る」 means "come". So, the full sentence reads:

- ==Famous== actress comes. / ==Famous== actress will come.

**Example 2**:

- ==静か== な町が素晴らしい。

Main car "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
==静か== な町が | 素晴らしい

In this sentence, 「静か」 means "quiet / peaceful", 「町」 means "town", 「素晴らしい」 means "wonderful". So, the full sentence reads:

- ==Peaceful== town is wonderful.

**Example 3**:

- ==真面目== なトムが医者だ。

Main car "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
==真面目== なトムが | 医者だ

In this sentence, 「真面目」 means "serious / honest", 「医者」 means "doctor". So, the full sentence reads:

- ==Honest== Tom is a doctor.

### Using a noun

We can **label** (not to be confused with **describe**) a noun with another noun by connecting them with the particle 「の」. (We will learn the difference between *labeling* and *describing* in the next section about no-adjectives).

Here are a few examples:

1. ==学校== の{++友達++}  
*==School== {++friends++}*

2. ==川== の{++流れ++}  
*{++Flow++} of ==river==*

3. ==ゼルダ== の{++伝説++}  
==Zelda== 's {++legend++} / *The {++legend++} of ==Zelda==*

4. ==３月== の{++ライオン++}  
*{++Lion++} of ==March==*

5. ==さくら== の{++本++}  
*==Sakura== 's {++book++}* / *{++Book++} of ==Sakura==*

6. ==アメリカ== の{++大学++}  
*==American== {++university++}*

7. ==大学== の{++学生++}  
*==University== {++student++}* / *{++Student++} of ==university==*

8. ==アメリカの大学== の{++学生++}  
*==American university== {++student++}* / *{++Student++} of an ==American university==*

The nouns highlighted in {++green++} are the ones getting labeled. The nouns highlighted in ==yellow== are the ones labeling them.

Let's go over each sentence briefly.

1. We're talking about 「友達」"friends", and the noun 「学校」"school" is labeling "what type of friends?" / "where are those friends from?"

2. We're talking about 「流れ」"flow", and the noun 「川」"river" is labeling "what type of flow?" / "flow of what?"

3. We're talking about 「伝説」"legend", and the noun 「ゼルダ」"Zelda" is labeling "whose legend?"

4. We're talking about 「ライオン」"lion", and the noun 「３月」"March" is labeling "lion from which month?"

5. We're talking about 「本」"book", and the noun 「さくら」"Sakura" is labeling "whose book?"

6. We're talking about 「大学」"university", and the noun 「アメリカ」"America" is labeling "what type of university?"

7. We're talking about 「学生」"student", and the noun 「大学」"university" is labeling "what type of students?" / "where are those students from?"

8. We're talking about 「学生」"student", and the noun 「アメリカの大学」"American university" is labeling "what type of students?" / "where are those students from?"

We will learn more about the particle 「の」 in a later section.

!!! tip "Did you know"
    The example sentence #4 is the name of a Manga and Anime series. The English name of the series is "March comes in like a lion".

### no-adjectives

Historically, Japanese did not have na-adjectives, and only had i-adjectives and nouns. In fact, in Japanese, "i-adjectives" are referred to as 「形容詞」 which literally means "adjective". The terms "i-adjective" and "na-adjective" are only really used when teaching Japanese to westerners, but I digress. Overtime, when new words were introduced into the language, they were added as **nouns**. These "new words" are primarily of Chinese origin, such as:

- 綺麗
- 元気
- 安全
- 簡単
- 失礼
- 健康
- 病気

but there are also some that are from other origins, such as English, French, German etc:

- リアル
- モダン
- スリリング
- アバンギャルド
- シュール
- シック
- ショック
- フレッシュ
- キュート
- カジュアル
- グレー
- ソロ

Some of these "new words" eventually evolved and became na-adjectives. As a result, some of these "new words" are now used as na-adjectives, but some are still used as nouns, and some are even used as both.

Here's a few examples of "new words" that became na-adjectives:

- 簡単 ==な== 問題
- 失礼 ==な== 人
- 健康 ==な== 人
- 元気 ==な== 人
- フレッシュ ==な== ジュース
- カジュアル ==な== 格好

Here's a few examples of "new words" that stayed as nouns (some dictionaries and textbooks call these **no-adjectives**):

- 病気 ==の== 人
- 普通 ==の== 態度
- 永遠 ==の== 関係
- 反対 ==の== 意見
- 三角 ==の== 紙
- 本当 ==の== 気持ち
- グレー ==の== 傘
- ソロ ==の== 演奏

!!! note "Side note"
    Within the set of "na-adjectives", there is also a small subset of native Japanese origin. Some examples are:

    - 静か
    - 爽やか
    - 明らか

#### The adjective ←→ noun spectrum [^1]

Adjectives and nouns are not black and white. They actually lie on a spectrum. Some words can be used as nouns (no-adjective) and also as adjectives (na-adjective). Of course, the meaning will also change depending on which one is being used. To best illustrate the change in meaning, let's look at some examples:

1. 綺麗な人  
*beautiful person*

2. 綺麗のヒント  
*beauty hints*

In the first sentence, 「綺麗」 is expressing a characteristic, quality, or attribute of 「人」. The word 「綺麗」 is acting as an adjective and it is **describing** 「人」. To briefly paraphrase what we learned about adjectives:

> Adjectives are words that expresses state, quality, property of an object.

Now, let's look at the second sentence. Here, 「綺麗」 is used with 「の」. We learned in the previous section that we can label a noun with another noun, and we connect them with the particle 「の」. Does that mean that 「綺麗」 is acting as a noun here? Absolutely. 「綺麗」 is not describing 「ヒント」, it is **labeling** it. The *hints* themselves are not beautiful, the hints are about beauty. 「綺麗」 is simply telling us what type of hints they are: they are not about finance or dating; they are about beauty.

Some words are always used with 「な」, some are always used with 「の」, and some are even used with both, just like the 「綺麗」 that we saw earlier. Here's a small chart that shows a few words in the 4 categories:

Always 「の」 | Usually 「の」＞「な」 | Usually 「な」＞「の」 | Always 「な」
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
少し | 大量 | 元気 | 簡単
本当 | 病気 | 健康 | 好き
永遠 | 最高 | 安全 | 大切
最大 | 普通 | 美人 | 静か
沢山 | 未定 | 不思議 | 大変
真実 | 独自 | 平和 | 素敵
一杯 | 最速 | 不安 | 勝手

na-adjectives can usually be modified by an adverb of degree, such as: 「すごく」(super), 「とても」(very), 「ちょっと」(a little), 「かなり」(fairly), 「あまり」(not very).

no-adjectives can be loosely divided into two groups:

1. words that expresses **absolutes**, such as 「本当」(true), 「最大」(the biggest)
2. words that expresses **quantities**, such as 「沢山」(many), 「大量」(large amount)

Let's look at two examples of no-adjectives that expresses **absolutes**:

- ==本当== の理由  
*==True== reason*

- ==最大== の原因  
*==The biggest== cause*

The fact that 「本当」 and 「最大」 are acting as nouns here might be hard for English speakers to see, since "true" and "biggest" are adjectives in English. Here's the logic behind it: a noun such as "dog" expresses absolutes. Something either is or isn't a dog. Similarly, something either is or isn't true. Something either is or isn't the biggest. That's not the case with na-adjectives. A na-adjective such as 「静か」(quiet) can be modified by an adverb of degree such as 「ちょっと静か」(a little quiet). However, the lack of grey area for absolutes like 「最大」 means that they can't be modified by an adverb of degree.

Now let's look at two examples of no-adjectives that expresses **quantities**:

- {++すごく++} ==沢山== の魚  
*{++Incredibly++} ==many== fish*

- {++かなり++} ==大量== のデータ  
*{++Fairly++} ==large amount== of data*

In the first example, 「沢山」 labels the noun 「魚」. It tells us that this is "a lot of fish" rather than "not a lot of fish". Likewise, in the second example, 「大量」 labels the noun 「データ」. It tells us that this is "a large amount of data" rather than "not a large amount of data".

However, quantities are inherently gradable; if we add more fish to 「沢山の魚」, then it would be fair to use an adverb of degree like 「すごく」 to say 「すごく沢山の魚」(incredibly many fish).

Let's go back to comparing na-adjectives vs no-adjectives by looking at the following 2 examples:

**Example 1**:

Person A: 新しい彼氏、有名な人？  
*Is your new boyfriend a famous person?*

Person B: ううん、普通 ==の== 人だよ。  
*No, he's a normal person*

In this example, *person B* chooses to answer the question with 「普通 ==の== 人」. This is because *person B* treats "normal" as a label for a type of people, and suggests that the boyfriend belongs in that category. Let's look at a conversation where using 「普通 ==な== 人」 would be more appropriate:

- 新しい彼氏、変な人？  
*Is your new boyfriend a weirdo?*

- ううん、普通 ==な== 人だよ。  
*No, he's a normal person*

In this case, it was less about labeling the boyfriend, and more about his personality or his intrinsic quality. For this reason, *person B* chose to use 「普通 ==な== 人」, highlighting normalness as a trait that characterizes the boyfriend. 「普通 ==の== 人」 is possible here too, if we decide to treat "weirdos" and "normal people" as categories of people.

**Example 2**:

1. その施設には、病気 ==の== 人が多い。
2. その施設には、病気 ==な== 人が多い。

*There are many sick people at that institution.*

In the first sentence, 「病気」 is labeling 「人」. It tells us that the sentences applies to *people who have disease*, rather than *people who don't*. This is the typical way that 「病気」 is used to modify a noun, and has a neutral and objective tone.

On the other hand, the second sentence, 「病気」 is describing 「人」. In this (possible, but uncommon) usage, 「病気」 is treated as a quality, property, nature of those people, which sounds negative and rude. It sounds something akin to the English phrase "sick in the head". 

This shouldn't be a surprise if we recall what we learned about adjectives and the copula. As a reminder, adjectives expresses property or quality of something; the copula (which is used for *nouns*) simply expresses "A belongs to the set of B".

If we choose to say 「病気 ==な== 人」, then 「病気」 is acting as an adjective, therefore we're expressing a property or quality of 「人」. We're saying that "being sick" is intrinsically a characteristic of those people (which is why it sounds negative and rude). However, if we say 「病気 ==の== 人」, then we're not treating 「病気」 as a intrinsic nature of those people; we're simply labeling them with a neutral tone as "people who have disease" / "people who are sick" (as opposed to people who aren't sick). We're saying with a neutral tone "people who belong to the set of people who are sick".
