!!! info "Author's note"
    Before we continue, I would like to clarify one thing.

    - Some example sentences in Japanese will have weird English translation.

    This is because I'm trying to convey the original Japanese meaning without losing any nuances. So, expect some example sentences to have weird sounding translations in this guide.

# Sentence Structures

## Subject-Object Structure

Every Japanese sentence at its core is composed of two elements: "A" and "B". Let's imagine these elements as part of a train, where "A" is the **main car** and "B" is the **engine**:

![](../../img/fundamentals/train.png)

We will visualize the train as the following table moving forward:

Main car "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
- | -

The engine "B" tells us **what the main car "A" is doing**. The main car "A" tells us **WHO or WHAT is doing engine "B"**. For example:

Main car "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
You | are a student
You | eat breakfast

We can add more cars to the train to convey more information, such as:

- Where did you eat breakfast?
- What time did you eat breakfast?
- With whom did you eat breakfast?
- etc

but the **core** of the train will always be "A" and "B". This train is what we call "**Subject-Object Structure**".

## Topic-Comment Structure

We learned in the previous section about Subject-Object Structure, which consists of two core elements: the main car "A" and the engine "B".

Main car "A" | Engine "B"
:---: | :---:
- | -

There's another type of structure: the Topic-Comment Structure, which also consists of two elements:

Topic | Comment
:---: | :---:
- | -

The important point here is that the "Comment" part is actually the *Subject-Object Structure* we just learned. In other words:

<table style="border: 1px solid black">
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">Topic üè≥Ô∏è</td>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Comment</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Main car "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">-</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">-</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">-</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Notice that I've depicted the topic as a flag üè≥Ô∏è. If the "Comment" is the "train" (main car "A" + engine "B"), then the "Topic" is like a flag in this analogy. The flag is not part of the train. The flag simply tells us the topic of the sentence/train.

A simpler visualization can be represented as following table:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Topic üè≥Ô∏è</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Main car "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black"> - </td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black"> - </td>
  </tr>
</table>

This is what our train looks like now:

!!! question "Why is it important to make the distinction between the two structures?"
    English is a subject-prominent language, but Japanese is a topic-prominent language. This difference in prominence is one of the reasons why a lot of people who learn Japanese whose native language is English, struggle to understand the difference between the particle „Äå„ÅØ„Äç and the particle „Äå„Åå„Äç. We will learn more about particles in a later section.
