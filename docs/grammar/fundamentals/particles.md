# Particles (basic)

!!! tip "Author's note"
    Particles can be very confusing especially for a beginner. If there's anything that I don't expect you to fully understand it by reading it once only, it will the particles. You should expect to come back and revisit this page (or any other resource) often if you encounter a particle in your input (reading and listening) that you don't understand. That being said, this page does not teach all the particles, nor does it teach all the different functions of each particle. If you're at intermediate level, I suggest you to look up the particle on a monolingual dictionary. Monolingual dictionaries give the best explanations.

## What are particles?
Let's use the following sentence to illustrate what a particle is:

Note: 「魚」 means "fish"  
「食べる」 means "eat"

- 魚食べる。

What is that sentence saying?

- Fish eats (something)
- (Something) eats fish

The answer is: it can be either one. So how do we know if "fish" is doing the "eating", or if "fish" is "being eaten"? In English, we can tell by simply looking at the word order: "fish eats X" vs "X eats fish". In Japanese, we can tell by looking at the particle.

Particles are one or more hiragana characters that attach to **the end of a word** to define the grammatical function of that word in the sentence. In other words, a particle defines the "role" of a word in a sentence. Using the correct particle is very important because the meaning of a sentence can completely change just by changing the particle.

For example:

- 魚 ==が== 食べる。  
Means "Fish eats (something)"
- 魚 ==を== 食べる。  
Means "(Something) eats fish"

We can finally put the knowledge from Sentence Structures into use. As a reminder, this is how we visualize our train analogy:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Topic 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Main car "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black"> - </td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black"> - </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Let's begin learning some basic particles. Each particle has more than one function. We will only learn a few basic usage for each particle for now.

## Topic particles

If we follow the analogy of the train, then topic particles are the particles that go into the "Topic 🏳️" part of the train. We will learn what this actually means when we learn about the particles themselves. There are two topics particles in Japanese: 「は」 and 「も」.

### 「は」

**「は」 is the topic particle**. To follow the analogy of our hypothetical train, **「は」is like a flag**. Why do we depict it as a flag? Because that's what it does. **It flags something as the topic of the sentence**. While the kana 「は」 is normally pronounced as 「は」, it is pronounced as 「わ」 when it is being used as the topic particle.

Let's look at an example sentence:

- 私は日本人だ

literally means:

- "As for me, (I) am Japanese" 
- "Speaking of me, (I) am Japanese"
- "In relation to me, (I) am Japanese" 

To visualize this, here's how it looks by using our train analogy:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">私は 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">Main car "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">Engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">日本人だ</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The full sentence in Japanese is 「私はØが日本人だ」. The zero pronoun (Ø) means "I" in this context (we learned this in the "Invisible main car "A" section). We marked 「私」 as the topic of our sentence by attaching the 「は」 particle to it. That same sentence in English would be:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">As for me 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">Main car "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">Engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">I</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">am Japanese</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Now, you might ask yourself, "Isn't this overcomplicated? Can't we just pretend that 「私は」 is the main car "A" and translate the sentence as simply "I am Japanese?". The answer is **NO**. Although it works in this example sentence, it doesn't work in every case and that's why you shouldn't do it. When you run into sentences where "pretending that 「は」 is the main car" doesn't work, now you suddenly can't understand the sentence and you get lost.

To illustrate why you shouldn't pretend that the topic is the main car, let's take a look at the following sentence:  

*A group of friends are dining at a restaurant, and one person tells the waiter:*

- 私は魚だ

The joke is that the person has literally said "I am a fish". After all, if 「私は日本人だ」 means "I am Japanese", then 「私は魚だ」 must mean "I am a fish", right? That makes perfect sense, except that 「私は日本人だ」 doesn't actually mean "I am Japanese"; it means "As for me, (I) am Japanese". This is why it is important to not pretend that the "topic" is the main car "A". If we look at the train for 「私は日本人だ」:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">私は 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">Main car "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">Engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">日本人だ</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Ø can be assumed to be "I" based on context. However, in the case of 「私は魚だ」, the train looks like this:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">私は 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">Main car "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">Engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">魚だ</td>
  </tr>
</table>

where Ø means "it". What is "it"? "It" is the thing we are talking about: *what we are eating for dinner*. So, the sentence 「私は魚だ」 actually means:

- As for me, (it) is fish.

Or in normal English, we would say "I'll have the fish" or "I'll go with the fish".

Another similar example:

おはようみんな。我、めずらしく午前中の目覚め。

まふくんおはようございます～
我は学校です。

To better understand what the topic particle **does** and what it **doesn't do**, let's look at another example sentence without 「は」.

Note: 「投げる」(なげる) means "throw"  
「ボール」 means "ball"

- 私がボールをさくらに投げる

Main car "A" | car 「を」 | car 「に」 | Engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
私が | ボールを | さくらに | 投げる

This sentence means "I throw a ball at Sakura" or "I throw a ball to Sakura". All three particles in this sentence -「が」,「を」and 「に」 tell us the "role" of each word that it's attached to. 「が」 tells us *who* threw the ball, 「を」 tells us *what* was thrown, 「に」 tells us *to whom* the ball was thrown.

!!! note
    We will learn more about 「が」,「を」and 「に」 in a later section.

Now that we've seen how those particles can affect the "role" of a word, let's introduce the 「は」 particle into the sentence to see what a topic particle does.

- 私はさくらにボールを投げる

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="4" style="text-align: center">私は 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">Main car "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">car 「に」</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">car 「を」</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">Engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">さくらに</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">ボールを</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">投げる</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This means "As for me, (I) throw the ball at Sakura".

We can give the flag to the "ball" instead:

- ボールは私がさくらに投げる

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="4" style="text-align: center">ボールは 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">Main car "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">car 「に」</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">car 「を」</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">Engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">私が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">さくらに</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø を</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">投げる</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This means "As for the ball, I throw (it) at Sakura". 

Notice how the logical meaning of the sentence doesn't change at all. Let us remind ourselves of the relationship between Topic-Comment and Structure-Object.

<table style="border: 1px solid black">
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black">Topic</td>
    <th colspan="4" style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Comment</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Main car</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">「に」</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">「を」</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">ボールは</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">私が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">さくらに</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">Ø を</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">投げる</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The "Topic" simply brings something up as... well, the topic of the conversation. It doesn't tell us anything *about* it. That's what the "Comment" is there for. The "Comment" is what tells us logical information. This is why the "Topic" doesn't change the logical meaning of the sentence.

**It is important to note that giving the 「は」 flag to a word can change the nuance of the sentence every so slightly**, but we don't have to worry about it for now. We will have a deeper look at these nuances in a later section.

### 「も」

**「も」 is the inclusive topic particle**. It is essentially the topic particle with the additional meaning of the English words "also" and "too". Basically, it can introduce another topic in addition to the current topic.

The particle 「も」 (and the English words "also" and "too" for that matter) can be broken down into two functions:

- Function 1: One person/thing "is" or "does" the same thing as another person/thing.  
Example:  
*Alice is studying. Bob is studying ==too==.*  
*Alice is studying. Bob is ==also== studying.*

- Function 2: If a person/thing "is" or "does" something, you can provide additional information about that person/thing.  
Example:  
*He is a brilliant linguist. He is ==also== interested in botany.*  
*He is a brilliant linguist. He is interested in botany ==too==.*

???+ info "Function 1: the comment of the new and old topic are the same"
    - 私 ==も== 学生だ。

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">私も 🏳️</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th style="text-align: center">Main car "A"</th>
        <th style="text-align: center">Engine "B"</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
        <td style="text-align: center">学生だ</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    *As for me ==too==, (I) am student.*

    Let's look at 「も」 in dialogues:

    **Example 1**

    ボブ： アリスは学⽣？  
    アリス： うん、トム ==も== 学⽣。

    *Literal translation*  
    Bob: As for Alice, are (you) a student?  
    Alice: Yes. As for Tom ==also==, (he) is a student.

    *Normal English*  
    Bob: Are you a student?  
    Alice: Yeah, Tom is student ==too==. / Yeah, Tom is ==also== a student.

    **The comments must be consistent (old and new)**. It would not make sense to say, "*I am a student (old comment), and Tom is not a student too (new comment).*" If the comments are NOT the same, we should use 「は」 to make a **contrast**. Let's look at the next example.

    !!! note 
        We will learn more about the **contrast** property of 「は」 in a later section when we compare 「は」 vs 「も」.

    **Example 2**

    ボブ： アリスは学⽣？  
    アリス： うん、でもトム ==は== 学⽣じゃない。

    *Literal translation*  
    Bob: As for Alice, are (you) a student?  
    Alice: Yes, but, as for Tom, (he) is not.

    *Normal English*  
    Bob: Are you a student?  
    Alice: Yeah, but Tom is not.

    **Example 3**

    If both comments are consistent, then we can use 「も」, just like we did in Example 1.

    ボブ：アリスは学⽣？  
    アリス：ううん、トム ==も== 学⽣じゃない。

    *Literal trasnlation*  
    Bob: As for Alice, are (you) a student?  
    Alice: No, as for Tom ==also==, (he) is not a student.

    *Normal English*  
    Bob: Are you a student?  
    Alice: No, Tom is not student either.

???+ info "Function 2: Provide additional relevant information"
    **Example 1**

    Person A: （私は）==君のことが好きだ==  
    Person B: 私も ==（君のことが）好きだ==

    *Literal translation*  
    Person A: (As for me), ==you are liked.==  
    Person B: As for me also, ==(you) are liked.==

    *Normal English*  
    Person A: I like ==you==.  
    Person B: I also like ==you==. (I like you too)

    This usage of 「も」 is simply providing us the additional information of "I like you too" (from Person B), on top of the previous information "I like you" (from Person A).

    **Example 2**

    Suppose you were working on something on a Sunday night. There's someone who is staying up with you to help you finish your task. Then you realize that it's already midnight and you want to let the other person know that it's OK to go to sleep now. You could say to the other person:

    - もう寝ていいよ。{++疲れた++}でしょう？明日は月曜日だから{++仕事 ==も== あるし++}。  
    Literally: *It's OK to sleep. {++Tired++}, right? Tomorrow is Monday so {++there is ==also== work++}.*  

    Or in normal English:

    *You can go to sleep now. {++You must be tired++}, right? It's Monday tomorrow so {++you ==also== have to work++}.*

    In this example, 「も」 is simply adding one more reason why that person should go to sleep now: "{++you have work tomorrow++}". The previous reason was "{++you must be tired++}".

**「も」 doesn't change the logical meaning of a sentence**

Just like 「は」, 「も」 doesn't change the logical meaning of the sentence either. After all, 「も」 is also a topic particle. This is true regardless of which function (function #1 or #2) 「も」 is doing in a particular sentence. Let's use the same example we saw in the section about 「は」 to illustrate how 「も」 doesn't change the logical meaning of a sentence.

- 私がさくらにボールを投げる

Main car "A" | car 「を」 | car 「に」 | Engine "B"
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
私が | ボールを | さくらに | 投げる

This means "I throw a ball at Sakura".

Now, let's add the 「も」 flag.

- 私もさくらにボールを投げる

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="4" style="text-align: center">私も 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">Main car "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">car 「に」</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">car 「を」</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">Engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">さくらに</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">ボールを</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">投げる</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This means "As for me too, (I) throw a ball at Sakura". In normal English, we might say "I also throw a ball at Sakura". Notice that the logical meaning of the sentence hasn't changed. The person throwing the ball (marked by 「が」) is still 「私」, the object being thrown is still 「ボール」, the recipient of the ball is still 「さくら」.

This is true regardless of the function of 「も」. If 「も」 is acting as **function #1**, then it could be something like:

- Bob throws a ball at Sakura. ==I also throw a ball at Sakura==.

If 「も」 is acting as **function #2**, then it could be something like:

- One time when I got angry, I punched and broke my TV. ==I also threw a ball at Sakura==.

I don't condone violence, but you get the idea. The logical meaning of the sentence doesn't change.

We can even give the flag to the "ball".

- ボールも私がさくらに投げる

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="4" style="text-align: center">ボールも 🏳️</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">Main car "A"</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">car 「に」</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">car 「を」</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">Engine "B"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">私が</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">さくらに</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">Ø を</td>
    <td style="text-align: center">投げる</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This means "As for the ball too, I throw (it) at Sakura". Again, the logical meaning of the sentence still doesn't change. The person throwing the ball is still 「私」, the object being thrown (marked by 「を」) is still 「ボール」, the recipient of the ball is still 「さくら」.

## Case marking particles

Case marking particles (格助詞) are particles that mark the role of a word in a sentence. This "role" defines the relationship between the word itself and the engine. 

!!! danger "REPEAT AFTER ME"
    Case marking particles define the relationship between the word that they are marking and **the Engine**.
    
    If the engine is 「食べる」(eat), then we can answer the following questions by simply looking at the case marking particles:

    - Who ate it? (marked by 「が」)
    - What was eaten? (marked by 「を」)
    - When was it eaten? (marked by 「に」)
    - Where was it eaten? (marked by 「で」)
    - With whom was it eaten? (marked by 「と」)
    - etc...

Each case marking particle has **more than one function**. We will learn only the basic functions for now.

### 「が」

???+ info "Function 1: Marks the subject (main car "A") of the sentence"
    **Example 1**

    - ==雨が== 降る  
    ==Rain== falls

    Main car "A" | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---:
    ==雨が== | 降る

    「が」 marks the subject of the sentence. In other words, it marks the main car "A". It marks the *doer*. It tells us *who* or *what* is doing the action of engine "B". Here, the engine "B" is the verb 「降る」(fall). What is falling? Rain is falling.

    **Example 2**

    - ==りんごが== 美味しい  
    ==Apple== is delicious

    Main car "A" | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---:
    ==りんごが== | 美味しい  

    Here, the engine is 「美味しい」(is delicious). What is delicious? Apple is delicious.

### 「を」

The kana 「を」 is normally pronounced as 「を」, but when it's used as a particle, it's pronounced as 「お」. You might ocassionally hear it actually being pronounced as 「を」 in some songs.

???+ info "Function 1: Marks the direct object of an action"
    **Example 1**

    - ==水を== 飲む  
    Drink ==water==

    Main car "A" | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==水を== | 飲む
    
    Here, the engine is 「飲む」(drink). In other words, the action is "drink". What are you drinking? What's the object that you're drinking? You're drinking water.

    **Example 2**

    - ==映画を== 見る  
    Watch ==movie==

    Main car "A" | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==映画を== | 見る  
    
    Here, the engine/action is 「見る」(watch). What are you watching? You're watching a movie.

    **Example 3**

    - ==ケーキを== 作る  
    Make ==cake==

    Main car "A" | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==ケーキを== | 作る  

    The engine is 「作る」(make). What are you making? A cake.

???+ info "Function 2: Marks the physical space of movement/motion"
    **Example 1**

    - ==階段を== 上がる  
    Go up ==the stairs==

    Main car "A" | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==階段を== | 上がる  

    The engine is 「上がる」(go up). In other words, the movement is "go up". What is the physical space in which you "go up"? The stairs.

    **Example 2**

    - ==階段を== 降りる  
    Go down ==the stairs==

    Main car "A" | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==階段を== | 降りる

    The movement is "go down". What is the physical space in which you are "going down"? The stairs.

    **Example 3**

    - ==空を== 飛ぶ  
    Fly ==in the sky==

    Main car "A" | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==空を== | 飛ぶ

    The engine is 「飛ぶ」(fly). The movement is "fly". What's the physical space in which you are flying? The sky.

    **Example 4**

    - ==公園を== 散歩する  
    Take a walk ==in the park==

    Main car "A" | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==公園を== | 散歩する

    The engine is 「散歩する」(stroll). The movement is "stroll". What's the physical space in which you are taking a stroll? The park.

    **Example 5**

    - ==山道を== 登る  
    Climb ==mountain path==

    Main car "A" | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==山道を== | 登る

    The movement is 「登る」(climb). What's the physical space in which you are climbing up? The mountain path.

    !!! tip
        One way to help remember this function of 「を」, is to treat it as if it was function #1. You can imagine the "physical space" as a literal direct object of your movement, where your footprints get left behind after you "move" across it.

        - ==階段を== 上がる  
        Go up ==the stairs==  
        You leave your footprints on the stairs when you go up the stairs.

        - ==空を== 飛ぶ  
        Fly ==in the sky==  
        You leave your footprints on the sky when you fly across it. (I'm streching this imagination very far. I know.)

        - ==公園を== 散歩する  
        Take a walk ==in the park==  
        You leave your footprints on the park when you walk along it.

        - ==山道を== 登る  
        Climb ==mountain path==  
        You leave your footprints on the mountain path when you climb it.

???+ info "Function 3: Marks the place of departure"
    **Example 1**

    - ==電車を== 降りる  
    Get off ==train==

    Main car "A" | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==電車を== | 降りる

    The engine is 「降りる」(get off). When you step out of the train, then the train will be the "starting point" of your movement.

    **Example 2**

    - ==家を== 出る  
    Leave ==house==

    Main car "A" | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==家を== | 出る

    The engine is 「出る」(exit). When you leave(exit) your house, then the house will be the "starting point" of your movement.

    **Example 3**
    
    - ==席を== 離れる  
    Leave ==seat==

    Main car "A" | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==席を== | 離れる

    The engine is 「離れる」 which means "to separate (from someting)" or "to distant (from something)" or "to go away (from something)". If you are sitting in your seat, and then stand up and leave, then you are separating yourself (physically) from the seat. The seat then becomes the "starting point" of this movement of "separation".

    **Example 4**

    - ==脇道を== 入る  
    Enter ==side road==

    Main car "A" | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==脇道を== | 入る

    The engine is 「入る」(enter). When enter into a side road, then the side road is the "starting point" of that entrance.

### 「に」

The particle 「に」 also has many functions. I personally like to think of the particle 「に」 as an **arrow**. Why? It will become apparent when we compare 「に」 to other particles in a later section.

???+ info "Function 1: Marks location of static verbs"
    Static verbs are verbs that have no movement. For example, "inhabit", "exist", "sit", "appear", etc.

    **Example 1**

    - ==日本に== 住む  
    Live ==in Japan==

    Main car "A" | 「に」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==日本に== | 住む

    Suzuki ate ==last==

    Main car "A" | 「に」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    鈴木さんが | ==最後に== | 食べた

    The engine is 「食べた」 which is the past tense of "eat". In what order? Suzuki was the last one to eat. Maybe Suzuki's friends started eating first.

    **Example 3**

    - ==月曜に== 宿題をやる  
    Do homework ==on Monday==

    Main car "A" | 「に」 | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==月曜に== | 宿題を | やる

    The engine is 「やる」(do). What are we doing? Homework (marked by 「を」). When will we do it? On Monday.

    **Example 4**

    - ==ゲームをセーブした後に== 寝る  
    (I) sleep ==after (I) save the game==

    Main car "A" | 「に」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==ゲームをセーブした後に== | 寝る

    The engine is 「寝る」(sleep), and we want to express the order in which we will do things. We will go to sleep *after*(後) we save the game.

    **Example 5**

    - ==寝る前に== 歯磨きする

    !!! warning
        「に」 can only be used with **specific time**, and NOT **relative time**.

        Examples of specific time:

        - １時 (1 o'clock)
        - ３月 (March)
        - １５日 (15th day of month)

    Ø が | ==家に== | 帰る

    The engine is 「帰る」 which means "go back" (specifically used for going back to where one is from). Where are we going back to? Home.

    **Example 3**

    - ==日本に== 帰る  
    Go back ==home==

    Main car "A" | 「に」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==日本に== | 帰る

    The engine is 「帰る」 again. Where are we going back to? Japan.

    **Example 4**

    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==駅に== | 着いた

    The engine is 「着いた」(arrived). Where is the destination of arrival? The station.

???+ info "Function 4: Marks the receiver of an action"
    Some resources call this "indirect object".

    **Example 1**

    - ==友達に== 花をあげる  
    Give flowers ==to friend==

    Main car "A" | 「に」 |  「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==友達に== | 花を | あげる

    The action is 「あげる」(give). What are we giving? Flowers (marked by 「を」). Who are we givint it to? Who is receiving the flowers? Friend.

    **Example 2**

    - ==神に== 誓う  
    Pray to ==God==

    Main car "A" | 「に」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==神に== | 誓う

    The action is 「祈る」(pray). Who are we praying to? Who is receiving our prayers? God.

    **Example 3**

    - ==友達に== 話す

    Main car "A" | 「に」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:

    :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==弟に== | 数学を | 教える 

    The action is 「教える」(teach). What are we teaching? Math (marked by 「を」). Who are we teaching it to? Who is receiving our teachings? Little brother.

    **Example 5**

    - ==読書に== 熱中する  
    Passionate about ==reading==
    
    Main car "A" | 「に」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==読書に== | 熱中する

    The action is 「熱中する」 which means "to be enthusiastic" or "to be passionate". This verb doesn't really translate well into English, since 「熱中する」 is an action (verb), but the English words "enthusiastic" and "passionate" are adjectives. Another translation (although not as accurate) is to say "Focus on reading". The action (verb) "to focus" means "to give your focus". If you are "focusing on reading" then you are "giving your focus to reading". Likewise, 「熱中する」 is "to enthusize" (if you will) which means "to give your enthusiasm" (or in normal English "to be enthusiastic").

    I digress. The action is 「熱中する」. What is receiving our passion? Reading.

    **Example 6**

    - ==友達に== 会う  
    Meet ==friend==

    Main car "A" | 「に」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==友達に== | 会う

    Ø が | ==君の意見に== | 賛成する

    The action is 「賛成する」(agree). What is receiving our agreement? "Your opinion" is receiving it.

???+ info "Function 5: Marks the object used as basis/standard for comparison"
    **Example 1**

    - 私が ==母に== 似ている  
    I resemble ==mother==

    Main car "A" | 「に」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    私が | ==母に== | 似ている

    The verb is 「似ている」(resemble). The subject is 「私」(I). Who do I resemble? Who do I look like? Mother. We are marking 「母」 with the particle 「に」 to say that "mother" is the basis/standard of comparison, and we're saying "I resembler her" or "I look like her".

    **Example 2**

    - ==海に== 近い  
    Close to ==sea==

    Main car "A" | 「に」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==海に== | 近い

    The engine is 「近い」 which means "is close" or "is nearby". What are we close to? The sea. We marked 「海」 with the particle 「に」 to say that we are close *to* it.

### 「へ」

The particle 「へ」 also has many functions that resembles the particle 「に」. The kana 「へ」 is normally pronounced as 「へ」, but when it is being used as a particle, it is always pronounced as 「え」. 

???+ info "Function 1: Marks the direction of an action"
    **Example 1**

    - ==南へ== 向かう  
    Head towards ==south==

    Main car "A" | 「へ」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==南へ== | 向かう

    The action is 「向かう」 which means "face towards" or "head towards". Which direction are we heading towards? South.

    **Example 2**

    - ==東へ== 進む  
    Advance towards ==east==

    Main car "A" | 「へ」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==東へ== | 進む

    The action is 「進む」 which means "advance towards" or "go forward". Which direction are we advacing towards? East.

???+ info "Function 2: Marks the receiver of an action"
    This is exactly like the "marks the receiver of an action" function from 「に」. However 「へ」 allows us to modify a word in a way that 「に」 cannot.
    
    **Example 1**

    - ==母へ== の手紙  
    A letter ==to mother==

    「手紙」 means "letter". If we ignore 「へ」 for now, and only look at the rest of the phrase: 「母の手紙」, then this phrase means "mother's letter". We already learned about describing a noun using another noun. In this case, 「母」 is telling us what kind of 「手紙」 it is, because those two words are connected with 「の」. So, the phrase "mother's letter" means that the letter is coming "from mother".

    Now, if we change the 「母」 part into 「母へ」, then that means "targeted at mother". So, if we take 「母へ」 and use it to describe 「手紙」」, then it will become 「==母へ==」+「の」+「{++手紙++}」 → 「==母へ== の{++手紙++}」: "==targeted at mother== {++letter++}". Or in normal English: "a letter to mother" or "a letter for mother". The letter is not *from mother*; the letter is *targeted at mother*.

    We can change this into a sentence (main car "A" + engine "B") to better understand what's going on:

    - 私が ==母へ== 手紙を書いた
    - 私が ==母に== 手紙を書いた

    Main car "A" | 「へ」 or 「に」 | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
    私が | ==母へ== | 手紙を | 書いた
    私が | ==母に== | 手紙を | 書いた

    We can use either 「へ」 or 「に」 to mark 「母」 and they would both mean the same thing. Both sentences can be translated as "I wrote a letter to mother". We can then re-arrange the order of the words to revert it back to how it was:

    - ⭕ 私が書いた母 ==へ== の手紙
    - ❌ 私が書いた母 ==に== の手紙

    *A letter that I wrote ==to== mother*

    If we recall what we learned about describing a noun using a verb, we can say:

    - ==私が書いた== 手紙  
    A letter ==that I wrote==

    to describe 「手紙」 with 「私が書いた」. We're talking about the 「手紙」(letter). What kind of letter? A letter that I wrote (私が書いた手紙). Now let's say that we want to be more specific, and include "A letter that I wrote ==to mother==*. To do this in Japanese, we simply include 「母へ」, and connect it to 「手紙」 with 「の」. The final result is:

    - 私が書いた ==母へ== の手紙  
    A letter that I wrote ==to mother==

    If we omit the 「私が書いた」 part, we now have what we saw at the beginning of this example:

    - (私が書いた) ==母へ== の手紙  
    A letter (that I wrote) ==to mother==

    !!! warning
        Notice that we CAN say:

        - ⭕ 母 ==へ== の手紙

        but we CANNOT say:

        - ❌ 母 ==に== の手紙

        this is because 「への」 is allowed, but 「にの」 is not. Why? Don't ask me. Here is what 明鏡国語辞典 says about this:

        > 「私は母 に／へ 手紙を書いた（→私が書いた母への手紙）」のように、名詞句では「にの」の形がないので、すべて「への」となる。

    **Example 2**

    - ==彼女へ== のプレゼントを買った  
    Bought a gift ==for girlfriend==

    Main car "A" | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==彼女へ== のプレゼントを | 買った

    Again, 「彼女へ」 means "targeted at girlfriend", and it is describing 「プレゼント」. So, 「彼女へのプレゼント」 means "gift for girlfriend". And the entire thing is marked by 「を」 to tell us *what* was bought.

???+ info "Function 3: Marks the destination of movement"
    This is exactly like the "marks the destination of a verb" function from 「に」.

    - ==学校へ== 行く  
    Go ==to school==

    - ==家へ== 帰る  
    Go back ==home==

    - ==日本へ== ようこそ！  
    Welcome ==to Japan==!

### 「で」

The particle 「で」 also has many functions, which I like to summarize as the **boundary** particle.

???+ info "Function 1: Marks the place where an action takes place"

    Main car "A" | 「で」 | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø | ==映画館で== | 映画を | 見た

    The action is 「見る」(see). What are we seeing? We are seeing 「映画」(movie). Where are we seeing the movie? we are seeing it at 「映画館」(movie theather).

???+ info "Function 2: Marks the instrument/material/method used to perform an action"
    **Example 1**

    - ==自転車で== 行く  
    Go by ==bike==

    Main car "A" | 「で」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø | ==自転車で== | 行く

    The action is 「行く」(go). By which means are we going? We are going by bike.

    **Example 2**

     - ==鉛筆で== 書く  
    Write with ==pencil==

    Main car "A" | 「で」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø | ==鉛筆で== | 書く

    The action is 「書く」(write). What instrument did we use to write? We used a pencil.

    **Example 3**

    - ==ラジオで== 話を聞いた  
    Heard the story on the ==radio==

    Main car "A" | 「で」 | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø | ==ラジオで== | 話を | 聞いた

    The action is 「聞く」(hear) in past-tense. What did we hear? We heard a 「話」(story). What instrument did we use to hear the story? We used a radio.

    **Example 4**

    - ==米で== 酒を作る  
    Make Sake out of ==rice==

    Main car "A" | 「で」 | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø | ==米で== | 酒を | 作る

    The action is 「作る」(make). What are we making? We are making 「お酒」(Sake). What ingredient was used to make it? Rice.

    **Example 5**

    - ==紙で== 飛行機を作る  
    Make airplane out of ==paper==

    Main car "A" | 「で」 | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø | ==紙で== | 飛行機を | 作る

    Again, we are saying "make an airplane". What ingredient was used to make it? Paper.

???+ info "Function 3: Marks the state/circumstance/condition in which an action happens"
    **Example 1**

    - ==大声で== 叫ぶ  
    Shout with ==loud voice==

    Main car "A" | 「で」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø | ==大声で== | 叫ぶ

    The action is 「叫ぶ」(shout). In what state or condition are we shouting? The state is "loud voice".
    
    **Example 2**

    - ==急ぎ足で== 歩く  
    Walk with ==fast pace==

    **Example 3**

    - ==裸足で== 出かける  
    Go out ==barefoot==

    Main car "A" | 「で」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø | ==裸足で== | 出かける

    The action is 「出かける」 which means "go out"(as in "leave or exit a building"). In which state are we going out? We are going out barefoot.

    **Example 4**

    - ==千円で== 釣りをください  
    Please give me my change in ==bills of 1000 yen==

    Main car "A" | 「で」 | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø | ==千円で== | 釣りを | ください

    The action is 「くださる」(give me) and it's inflected to express a "request". So, 「ください」 means "please give me" (requesting the other person to "give me"). What is the object that is being given? It's the 「釣り」(change). But we don't want them in 5 yen coins. We wan't them in bills of 1000 yen. In other words, the "state" in which the 「釣り」 will be given, is in "bills of 1000 yen".  

### 「と」

???+ info "Function 1: Used for listing things"
    **Example 1**

    Let's say you want to express "There is a book on the desk":

    - 机の上に本がある  
    There is a book on the desk

    「に」 | Main car "A" | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    机の上に | 本が | ある

    Now, let's say you want to express "There is a book **and a pen** on the desk":

    - 机の上に ==本と== ==ペンと== がある  
    There is ==a book== and ==a pen== on the desk

    If we want to list things, such as "W, X, Y, and Z", we attach 「と」 to each item, like so 「WとXとYとZと」. So, if we want to list "book and pen", we say:

    - 本とペンと
    
    「と」 | 「と」
    :---: | :---:
    本と | ペンと

    Next, 「本とペンと」(book and pen) are the things that are on the desk. In other words "book and pen" is the main car "A".

    「に」 | Main car "A" | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    机の上に | ==本と== ==ペンと== が | ある

    **Example 2**

    - ==本と== ==ペンと== を買う  
    Buy ==a book== and ==a pen==

    Again, 「本とペンと」 means "book and pen". The engine here is 「買う」(buy). What are the things that we are buying? Book and pen. Therefore "book and pen" has to be marked by 「を」(the "marks the direct object of an action" function from 「を」):

    Main car "A" | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==本と== ==ペンと== を | 買う

    !!! tip "The last 「と」 is optional"
        When we list things using 「と」, the last 「と」 is optional .

        - ==君と僕== が選ばれた  
        - ==君と僕と== が選ばれた  

        are both acceptable. Likewise:

        - ==犬と猫== を飼う  
        - ==犬と猫と== を飼う  

        are also acceptable.

???+ info "Function 2: Marks the counterpart of an action"
    There are certain actions (verbs) that, by definition, will always have two sides to it. Examples of these actions are:

    - Marry
    - Fight
    - Playing tennis
    - etc

    **Example 1**

    - ==花子と== 結婚する  
    (I) marry ==Hanako==

    Main car "A" | 「と」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==花子と== | 結婚する

    Here, the action is 「結婚する」(marry). The action "marry" requires two people. On one side is 「Ø」, which we can assume to be 「私」(I) based on context. On the other side is 「花子」, which is marked by 「と」. This is an "A does B" sentence, where "A" is "I", and "the action I'm doing" is "marry". The counterpart of this "marriage" is "Hanako".

    **Example 2**

    - ==太郎と== 戦う  
    Fight against ==Tarou==

    Main car "A" | 「と」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==太郎と== | 戦う

    Here, the action is 「戦う」(fight). The action "fight" requires two sides. On one side is 「Ø」, which we can again assume to be 「私」(I) based on context. On the other side is 「太郎」, which is marked by 「と」. This is an "A does B" sentence, where "A" is "I", and "the action I'm doing" is "fight". The counterpart of this "fight" is "Tarou".

???+ info "Function 3: Marks the person or thing that an aciton is performed together with"
    This is different from the previous function, although not many dictionaries and textbooks make a distinction between this function and the previous one. They just lump these two functions into one function, thinking they are the same.

    **Example 1**

    - ==花さんと== 勉強する  
    Study ==with Hanako==

    Main car "A" | 「と」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==花さんと== | 勉強する

    Here, the action is 「勉強する」(study), and we are doing it TOGETHER WITH 「花子さん」(Hanako).

    **Example 2**

    - ==友達と== 買い物をする  
    Shop ==with friend==

    Main car "A" | 「と」 | 「を」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==友達と== | 買い物を | する

    The action is 「買い物をする」(to shop), and we are doing it TOGETHER WITH 「友達」(friend).

    **Example 3**

    - ==みんなと== 行く  
    Go ==with everyone==

    Main car "A" | 「と」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==みんなと== | 行く

    The action is 「行く」(go), and we are *going* (somewhere) TOGETHER WITH 「みんな」(everyone).

    **More in-depth explanation**

    This function of 「と」 can be replaced with 「と{++一緒に++}」 and the meaning of the overall sentence will NOT change. The word 「一緒に」 literally means "together".

    - ==花さんと=={++一緒に++}勉強する  
    Study {++together++} ==with Hanako==
    - ==友達と=={++一緒に++}買い物をする  
    Shop {++together++} ==with friend==
    - ==みんなと=={++一緒に++}行く  
    Go {++together++} ==with everyone==

    !!! danger "How is this function different from the previous one?"
        I'm glad you asked :)

        **Example 1**

        Let's take this English phrase as example:

        - I fight with you

        There are 2 interpretations here:

        1. I fight *against* you
        2. I fight *alongside* you

        The first interpretation is using the 「と」 as "*Function #2: Marks the counterpart of an action*".

        The second interpretation is using the 「と」 as "*Function #3: Marks the person or thing that an aciton is performed together with*". **THIS** is the interpretation that can replace 「と」 with 「と一緒に」 and the meaning won't change. Like we saw earlier, the phrase "I fight with you" can have 2 interpretations. But if we explicitly said "I fight *together* with you", then we know for sure that we mean "I fight *alongside* you".

        **Example 2**

        Now let's look at these sentences[^1]:

        [^1]: [文法指導と文法的思考法 : 助詞・助動詞、形容詞・形容動詞について](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/78600687.pdf)

        1. 花子さんと勉強する
        2. 花子さんと喧嘩する
        3. 花子さんとデートする
        4. 花子さんと結婚する

        Which of these sentence can we replace 「と」 with 「と一緒に」 and the overall meaning of the sentence remains unchanged? The answer is **1**.

        In the first sentence, the 「と」 is actually being used as "together with". We're saying 「花子さんと（一緒に）勉強する」 or "(I) study (together) with Hanako". The 「と」 as "function #3" can be replaced with 「と一緒に」 and the meaning will not change.

        However, sentences 2, 3, and 4 are different. The 「と」 from those sentences is the 「と」 as "function #2: marks the counterpart". Let's take sentence 4 as example. If we were to change this:

        - 花子さんと結婚する

        to this:

        - 花子さんと{++一緒に++}結婚する

        then we are no longer saying "(I) marry *to* Hanako". Instead we would be saying, "I marry to person X. Hanako marries to person Y. Hanako and I are simply marrying *at the same time together*". Remember that once we use 「と一緒に」 then we are explicitly using the 「と」 with "function #3". This means that "Hanako" is no longer the "counterpart" of my marriage.

        **Example 3**

        Similar to the previous example, let's look at this sentence:

        - ==花子さんと== テニスをする  
        Play tennis ==with Hanako==

        Again, this could be interpreted in two ways, but the most likely scenario is that we are saying "playing tennis *against* Hanako". Hanako is our oponent. This means that the 「と」 in this sentence is being used as "function #2".

        If we were to say:

        - 花子さんと{++一緒に++}テニスをする

        Then we are no longer saying "play tennis with Hanako" in the sense that Hanako is our oponent. We are now saying that Hanako is in our team and we are playing *alongside* Hanako (presumably a 2vs2 match). In this case, the 「と」 is for sure being used as "function #3".

        **Why do I bother with the distinction of these two functions?**

        Because, you might encounter 「と一緒に」 in your input (listening and reading) in places where there "**shouldn't**" be a 「一緒に」. When you do encounter those scenarios, you can now pick up on the (not so) subtle nuance.

        When I say "**shouldn't**", I mean cases like, for example, 「花子と戦う」 where it's *usually* interpreted as "against". But if you see 「花子と一緒に戦う」, then you can know for sure that it means "alongside".

???+ info "Function 4: Marks the object used for comparison"
    **Example 1**

    - ==以前と== 同じだ  
    (It) is the same as ==before==

    Main car "A" | 「と」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    Ø が | ==以前と== | 同じだ

    We are marking 「以前」(before) as the thing we want to compare to, and then we are saying "it is the same".

    **Example 2**

    - 考え方が ==君と== 違う  
    Way of thinking differs ==from you==

    Main car "A" | 「と」 | Engine "B"
    :---: | :---: | :---:
    考え方が | ==君と== | 違う

    The engine is 「違う」(to differ), and we are saying that 「考え方」(way of thinking) differs. We then mark 「君」(you) with 「と」 to use it as comparison and say "way of thinking differs *from you*". In normal English we might say "My way of thinking is different from yours" or "I don't think the way you do".

### 「の」

The particle 「の」 has many functions, one of which we already learned in the section about describing a noun using another noun. Let's learn about a few more functions here.

???+ info "Function 1: Replacement or omission of noun"

    The noun that is being described/labeled can be omitted or replaced by 「の」 if the context clearly indicates what is being omitted.

    Let's briefly refresh our memory of how to describe a noun:

    Using a verb:

    - ==壊れた== {++パソコン++}  
    {++Computer++} ==that broke==

    Using an adjective:

    - ==新しい== {++シャツ++}  
    ==New== {++shirt++}

    - ==簡単な== {++試験++}  
    ==Easy== {++exam++}

    Using another noun

    - ==大学== の{++学生++}  
    ==College== {++student++}

    The nouns highlighted in {++green++} are the nouns that are being described/labeled by the words highlighted in ==yellow==. These words highlighted in green are the ones that can be: 

    1. replaced by 「の」 or
    2. omitted altogether

    if the context clearly indicates what is being omitted.

    Let's look at a few examples.

    ???+ example "Examples of REPLACEMENT"
        If the noun is being described by a **verb** or an **adjective**, we replace the noun with 「の」

        **Example 1: verb**

        - 勝った{++人++}は君じゃなくて私だよ。  
        *The {++person++} who won is not you, it's me*

        After replacing 「人」 with 「の」:

        - 勝った{++の++}は君じゃなくて私だよ。  
        *The {++one++} who won is not you, it's me*

        **Example 2: i-adjective**

        - Person A: パソコン壊れた？  
        Did your computer break?

        - Person B: うん、でももう新しい{++パソコン++}を買った。  
        Yeah, but I bought a new {++computer++} already.

        After replacing 「パソコン」 with 「の」:

        - Person A: パソコン壊れた？  
        Did your computer break?

        - Person B: うん、でももう新しい{++の++}を買った。  
        Yeah, but I bought a new {++one++} already.

        **Example 3: na-adjective**

        - Person A: 大事なことは何を言ってるかじゃなくて、言い方だよ。  
        The important thing is not what you say, but how you say it

        - Person B: 私も大事な{++こと++}は言い方だと思う。  
        I also think that the important {++thing++} is how you say it

        After replacing 「こと」 with 「の」：

        - Person A: 大事なことは何を言ってるかじゃなくて、言い方だよ。  
        The important thing is not what you say, but how you say it

        - Person B: 私も大事な{++の++}は言い方だと思う。  
        I also think that the important {++thing++} is how you say it

        !!! warning "Pay attention to 「な」"
            Notice that 「大事 ==な== こと」 changes to 「大事 ==な== の」. The 「な」 cannot be omitted. After all the thing we're omitting/replacing is only the noun itself. This applies for all na-adjectives.

    ???+ example "Examples of OMISSION"
        If the noun is being described by another **noun** (which means there is already a 「の」 linking them), we simply omit the noun.

        **Example 1:**

        - Person A: そのシャツは誰の{++シャツ++}？  
        As for that shirt, whose {++shirt++} is it?

        - Person B: ボブの{++シャツ++}だ。  
        It is Bob's {++shirt++}.

        After omitting 「シャツ」:

        - Person A: そのシャツは誰の？  
        As for that shirt, whose is it?

        - Person B: ボブのだ。  
        It is Bob's.

        **Example 2**

        - Person A: ケーキ食べてみた？  
        Did you try the cakes?

        - Person B: うん。イチゴの{++ケーキ++}は美味しかったけど、チョコの{++ケーキ++}はあんまり。  
        Yeah. The strawberry {++cake++} was delicious but the chocolate {++cake++} not so much.

        After omitting 「ケーキ」:

        - Person A: ケーキ食べてみた？  
        Did you try the cakes?

        - Person B: うん。イチゴのは美味しかったけど、チョコのはあんまり。  
        Yeah. The strawberry {++one++} was delicious but the chocolate {++one++} not so much.

### 「から」

This particle is pretty much a 1 to 1 equivalent to the English word "from" (this doesn't mean that you should translate every English sentence, word for word into Japanese simply because it has the word "from" in it. More often than not, that's not the natural way to express that idea in Japanese)

???+ info "Function 1: Marks the starting time"
    **Example 1**

    - 学校は ==明日から== 始まる  
    School starts ==from tomorrow==

    **Example 2**

    - 会議が ==1時から== 始まった  
    The meeting started ==from 1 o'clock==

    **Example 3**

    - ==最初から== 嘘ついた  
    Lied ==from the beginning==

???+ info "Function 2: Marks the starting point of motion"
    **Example 1**

    - 虫が ==窓から== 入った  
    The insect came in ==from the window==

    **Example 2**

    - アリスは ==アメリカから== 来た  
    Alice came ==from America==

    **Example 3**

    - ==家から== 歩く  
    Walk ==from home==

    **Example 4**

    - ==ここから== 出発する  
    Leave ==from here==

???+ info "Function 3: Marks the giver of action"
    **Example 1**

    - 情報は ==私から== 先生に伝える  
    As for the information, (I) report (it) ==from me== to teacher

    **Example 2**

    - ==彼女から== プレゼントをもらった  
    Received a gift ==from girlfriend==

???+ info "Funcion 4: Marks the ingredient used for an action"
    **Example 1**

    - ワインは、==ブドウから== 作られる  
    As for wine, (it) is made ==from grapes==

### 「まで」

This particle means "until" (and more), and it is more flexible than the English word "until".

???+ info "Function 1: Marks the ending time or condition"
    **Example 1**

    - ==明日まで== 休む  
    Take a break ==until tomorrow==

    **Example 2**

    - ==昼まで== 寝た  
    Slept ==until noon==

    **Example 3**

    - ==これが終わるまで== 帰れない  
    Can't go home ==until this finishes==

    **Example 4**

    - ==今まで== ありがとう  
    ==Until now== thank you

    In normal English, we might say "Thank you for everything *so far*".

    **Example 5**

    - ==6時まで== 待つ  
    Wait ==until 6 o'clock==

    **Example 6**

    - ==勝つまで== やる  
    Do it ==until win==

???+ info "Function 2: Marks the ending point of motion"
    **Example 1**

    - 一緒に ==駅まで== 行く  
    Go together ==until the station==

    Notice that I didn't use "to the station" in the translation. If we had said

    - 一緒に ==駅に== 行く

    then that *could* have been translated as "Go together ==to the station==".

    The difference is that, by saying 「駅まで」(until the station), we are implying "go together ALL THE WAY UNTIL we reach the station".

    **Example 2**

    - ==屋根まで== 飛んだ  
    Flew ==all the way to the roof==

    **Example 3**

    - ==福岡まで== 行く  
    Go ==all the way until Fukuoka==

### 「から」 with 「まで」

These two particles are often used together to express "from... to/until ...".

**Example 1**

- 仕事は ==9時から== ==5時まで== だ  
As for work, (it) is ==from 9 o'clock== ==to 5 o'clock==

**Example 2**

- ==家から== ==学校まで== 歩く  
Walk ==from home== ==to school==
